<p>The object of this little work, and of others of its
family, which may perhaps follow, is, like that of
the &ldquo;Rollo Books,&rdquo; to furnish useful and instructive
reading to young children. The aim is not
so directly to communicate knowledge, as it is to
develop the moral and intellectual powers,&mdash;to
cultivate habits of discrimination and correct
reasoning, and to establish sound principles of
moral conduct. The &ldquo;Rollo Books&rdquo; embrace
principally intellectual and moral discipline;
&ldquo;Caleb,&rdquo; and the others of its family, will include
also <i>religious</i> training, according to the evangelical
views of Christian truth which the author
has been accustomed to entertain, and which he
has inculcated in his more serious writings.</p>

<h3>CALEB'S DISCOVERY.</h3>

<p>Caleb was a bright-looking, blue-eyed boy,
with auburn hair and happy countenance.
And yet he was rather pale and slender.
He had been sick. His father and mother
lived in Boston, but now he was spending
the summer at Sandy River country, with
his grandmother. His father thought that
if he could run about a few months in the
open air, and play among the rocks and under
the trees, he would grow more strong
and healthy, and that his cheeks would not
look so pale.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>His grandmother made him a blue jacket
with bright buttons. <i>She</i> liked metal buttons,
because they would wear longer than
covered ones, but <i>he</i> liked them because
they were more beautiful. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;I can see my face in them, grandmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little Caleb then went to the window, so
as to see his face plainer. He stood with
his back to the window, and held the button
so that the light from the window could
shine directly upon it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why grandmother,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;I
cannot see now so well as I could before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is because your face is turned
away from the light,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the button is turned <i>towards</i> the
light,&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when you want to see any thing reflected
in a glass, you must have the light
shine upon the thing you want to see reflect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>ed,
not upon the glass itself; and I suppose
it is so with a bright button.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Caleb turned around, so as to have
his <i>face</i> towards the light; and he found
that he could then see it reflected very distinctly.
His grandmother went on with her
work, and Caleb sat for some time in silence.</p>

<p>The house that Caleb lived in was in a
narrow rocky valley. A stream of water ran
over a sandy bed, in front of the house, and
a rugged mountain towered behind it.
Across the stream, too, there was a high,
rocky hill, which was in full view from the
parlour window. This hill was covered with
wild evergreens, which clung to their sides,
and to the interstices of the rocks; and
mosses, green and brown, in long festoons,
hung from their limbs. Here and there
crags and precipices peeped out from among
the foliage, and a grey old cliff towered
above, at the summit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Caleb turned his button round again towards
the window, and of course turned his
face <i>from</i> the window. The reflection of his
face was now dim, as before, but in a moment
his eye caught the reflection of the
crags and trees across the little valley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, grandmother,&rdquo; said he again, &ldquo;I
can see the rocks in my buttons, and the
trees. And there is an old stump,&rdquo; he continued,
his voice falling to a low tone, as if
he was talking to himself,&mdash;&ldquo;and there is
a tree,&mdash;and,&mdash;why&mdash;why, what is that? It
is a bear, grandmama,&rdquo;&mdash;calling aloud to
her,&mdash;&ldquo;I see a bear upon the mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Caleb,&rdquo; said the grandmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do certainly,&rdquo; said Caleb, and he
dropped the corner of his jacket, which had
the button attached to it, and looked out of
the window directly at the mountain.</p>

<p>Presently Caleb turned away from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
window, and ran to the door. There was a
little green yard in front of the house, with
a large, smooth, flat stone for a door-step.
Caleb stood on this step, and looked intently
at the mountain. In a moment he
ran back to his grandmother, and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother, <i>do</i> come and see this
black bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, child,&rdquo; said she, smiling, &ldquo;it is
nothing but some old black stump or log.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it moves, grandmother. It certainly
moves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So his grandmother smiled, and said,
&ldquo;Well, I suppose I must come and see.&rdquo;
So she laid down her work, and took off her
spectacles, and Caleb took hold of her hand,
and trotted along before her to the step of the
door. It was a beautiful sunny morning in
June.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Caleb, triumphantly pointing
to a spot among the rocks and bushes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
half-way up the mountain,&mdash;&ldquo;there, what do
you call that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His grandmother looked a moment intently
in silence, and then said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do see something there under the
bushes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And isn't it moving?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And isn't it black?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it is a bear,&rdquo; said Caleb, half-delighted,
and half afraid, &ldquo;Isn't it, grandmother?
I'll go and get the gun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an old gun behind the high desk,
in the back sitting-room; but it had not
been loaded for twenty years, and had no back
upon it. Still Caleb always supposed that
some how or other it would shoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I, grandmother?&rdquo; said he eagerly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I don't think it is a
bear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is Cherry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cherry!&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Cherry,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Run and see
if you can find the boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cherry was the cow. She had strayed from
the pasture the day before, and they could
not find her. She was called Cherry from
her colour; for although she had looked almost
black, as Caleb had seen her in the
bushes, she was really a Cherry colour. Caleb
saw at once, as soon as his grandmother
said that it was Cherry, that she was correct.
In fact, he could see her head and horns, as
she was holding her head up to eat the leaves
from the bushes. However he did not stop
to talk about it, but, obeying his grandmother
immediately, he ran off after the boys.</p>

<p>He went out to the back door, where the
boys had been at play, and shouted out,
&ldquo;<i>David</i>! <span class="smcap">Da&mdash;vid</span>! <span class="smcap">Dwi&mdash;ght</span>! <span class="smcap">Da&mdash;vid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></span>!&rdquo;
But there was no reply, except a distant echo
of &ldquo;<i>David</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Dwight</i>&rdquo; from the rocks
and mountains.</p>

<p>So Caleb came back, and said that he
could not find the boys, and that he supposed
that they had gone to school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we must call Raymond,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And may I ring for him, grandmother?&rdquo;
said Caleb.</p>

<p>Grandmother said he might: and so Caleb
ran off to the porch at the back door, and
took down quite a large bell, which was
hanging there. Caleb stood upon the steps
of the porch, and grasping the great handle
of the bell with both hands, he rang it with
all his might. In a minute or two he stopped;
and then he heard a faint and distant
&ldquo;Aye-aye&rdquo; coming, from a field. Caleb put
the bell back into its place, and then went
again to his grandmother.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Raymond came in. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
was a thick-set and rather tall young man,
broad-shouldered and strong,&mdash;slow in his
motions, and of a very sober countenance.
Caleb heard his heavy step in the entry,
though he came slowly and carefully, as if he
tried to walk without making a noise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you want me, Madam Rachel?&rdquo; said
he, holding his hat in his hand.</p>

<p>Caleb's grandmother was generally called
Madam Rachel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Cherry has got up on
the rocks. Caleb spied her there; he will
shew you where, and I should like to have
you go and drive her down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb wanted to go too; but his grandmother
said it would not do very well, for he
could not keep up with Raymond; and besides,
she said that she wanted him. So
Caleb went out with Raymond under the
great elm before the house, and pointed out
the place among the rocks, where he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
seen Cherry. She was not there then, at
least she was not in sight; but Raymond
knew that she could not have gone far from
the place, so he walked down over the bridge,
and soon disappeared.</p>

<p>While Caleb stood watching Raymond, as
he walked off with long strides towards the
mountain, his grandmother came to the door
and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Caleb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb turned and ran to his grandmother.
She had in her hand a little red morocco
book, and taking Caleb's hand, she went
slowly up stairs, he frisking and capering
around her all the way. There was a bed
in the room, with a white covering, and by
the window an easy chair, with a high back,
and round well-stuffed arms. Madam Rachel
went to the easy chair and sat down
and took Caleb in her lap. Caleb looked
out upon the long drooping branches of the
elm which hung near the window.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Caleb's countenance was pale; and he
was slender in form, and delicate in appearance.
He had been sick, and even now, he
was not quite well. His little taper fingers
rested upon the window-sill, while his
grandmother opened her little Bible and began
to read. Caleb sat still in her lap,
with a serious and attentive expression of
countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two men went up into the temple to
pray; the one a pharisee, the other a publican.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is a pharisee and a publican?&rdquo;
asked Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will hear presently. 'And the
pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself:
God, I thank thee that I am not as
other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are all those?&rdquo; asked Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, different kinds of crimes and sins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
The pharisee thanked God that he had not
committed any of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he a good man, grandmother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely he had not committed any
of these great crimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, grandmother, go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Or even as this publican.' A publican,
you must know, was a tax-gatherer.
He used to collect the taxes from
the people. They did not like to pay their
taxes, and so they did not like the tax-gatherers,
and despised them. And thus the
pharisee thanked God that he was not like
that publican. 'I fast twice in the week.
I pay tithes of all that I possess.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tithes?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was money which God had
commanded them to pay. They were to pay
in proportion to the property they had. But
some dishonest men used to conceal some of
their property, so as not to have to pay so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
much; but this pharisee said <i>he</i> paid
tithes of <i>all</i> that he possessed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was right, grandmother,&rdquo; said
Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said his grandmother, &ldquo;that was
very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he really did it,&rdquo; continued Caleb
doubtfully. &ldquo;Do you think he did, grandmother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it very probable. I presume
he was a pretty good man, <i>outside</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that, grandmother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, his heart might have been bad,
but he was probably pretty careful about
all his <i>actions</i>, which could be seen of men.
But we will go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;'And the publican, standing afar off,
would not lift up so much as his eyes to
heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,
God be merciful to me a sinner. I tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
you this man went down to his house justified
rather than the other.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which man?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The publican.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The publican was justified?&rdquo; said Caleb,
&ldquo;what does <i>justified</i> mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgiven and approved. God was pleased
with the publican, because he confessed
his sins honestly; but he was displeased
with the pharisee, because he came boasting
of his good deeds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here there was a pause. Caleb sat still
and seemed thoughtful. His grandmother
did not interrupt him, but waited to hear
what he would say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but, grandmother, if the pharisee
really was a good man, it wasn't right for
him to thank God for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It reminds me of Thomas's acorns,&rdquo;
said Madam Rachel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thomas's acorns!&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;tell
me about them, grandmother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Thomas and his brother George
were sent to school. They stopped to play
by the way, until it was so late that they
did not dare to go in. Then they staid playing
about the fields till it was time to go
home. They felt pretty bad and out of humour,
and at last they separated and went
home different ways.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In going home, Thomas found an oak-tree
with acorns under it. 'Ah!' said he,
'I will carry mother home some acorns.'
He had observed that his mother was pleased
whenever he brought her things; and he
had an idea of soothing his own feelings of
guilt, and securing his mother's favour, by
the good deed of carrying her home some
acorns. So, when he came into the house,
he took off his hat carefully, with the acorns
in it, and holding it in both hands, marched
up to his mother with a smiling face, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
look of great self-satisfaction, and said,
'Here, mother, I have got you some acorns.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did his mother say?&rdquo; asked
Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She shook her head sorrowfully, and
told him to go and put the acorns away.
She knew where he had been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then presently George came in. He
put away his cap, walked in softly, and put
his face down in his mother's lap, and said,
with tears and sobs, 'Mother, I have been
doing something very wrong.' Now, which
of these do you think came to his mother
right?'&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&mdash;George,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and that was the way the publican
came; but the pharisee covered up all his
sins, being pleased and satisfied himself,
and thinking that God would be pleased
and satisfied with his <i>acorns</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Madam Rachel paused, and Caleb
sat still, thinking of what he had heard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Madam Rachel then closed her eyes, and,
in a low, gentle voice, she spoke a few words
of prayer; and then she told Caleb that he
must always remember in all his prayers to
confess his sins fully and freely, and never
cover them up and conceal them, with an
idea that his good deeds made him worthy.
Then she put Caleb down, and he ran down
stairs to play.</p>

<p>He asked his grandmother to let him go
over the bridge, so as to be ready to meet
Raymond, when he should come back with
the cow. She at first advised him not to
go, for she was afraid, she said, that he
might get lost, or fall into the brook; but
Caleb was very desirous to go, and finally
she consented. He had a little whip that
David had made for him. The handle was
made from the branch of a beach-tree, which
David cut first to make a cane of, for himself;
but he broke his cane, and so he gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Caleb the rest of the stick for a whip-handle.
The lash was made of leather. It was
cut out of a round piece of thick leather,
round and round, as they made leather
shoe-strings, and then rolled upon a board.
This is a fine way to make lashes and reins
for boys.</p>

<p>Caleb took his whip for company, and
sauntered along over the bridge. When he
had crossed the bridge, he walked along the
bank of the stream, watching the grass-hoppers
and butterflies, and now and then cutting
off the head of a weed with the lash of
his whip.</p>

<p>The banks of the brook were in some places
high, and the water deep; in other places,
there was a sort of beach, sloping down
to the water's edge; and here, the water
was generally shallow, to a considerable
distance from the shore. Caleb was allowed
to come down to the water at these shal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>low
places; but he had often been told that
he must not go near the steep places, because
there was danger that he would fall in.</p>

<p>Now, boys are not very naturally inclined
to obey their parents. They have to be
taught with great pains and care. They
must be punished for disobedience, in some
way or other, a good many times. But neglected
children, that is, those that are left
to themselves, are almost always very disobedient
and unsubmissive. Caleb, now,
was not a neglected child. He had been
taught to submit and obey, when he was
very young, and his grandmother could trust
him now.</p>

<p>Besides, Caleb, had still less disposition
now to disobey his grandmother than usual,
for he had been sick, and was still pale and
feeble; and this state of health often makes
children quiet, gentle, and submissive.</p>

<p>So Caleb walked slowly along, carefully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
avoiding all the high banks, but sometimes
going down to the water, where the shore
was sloping and safe. At length, at one of
these little landing places he stopped longer
than usual. He called it the cotton landing.
David and Dwight gave it that name,
because they always found, wedged in, in a
corner between a log and the shore, a pile
of cotton, as they called it. It was, in reality,
light, white froth, which always lay
there; and even if they pushed it all away
with a stick, they would find a new supply
the next day. Caleb stood upon the shore,
and with the lash of his whip, cut into the
pile of &ldquo;cotton.&rdquo; The pile broke up into
large masses, and moved slowly and lightly
away into the stream. One small tuft of it
floated towards the shore, and Caleb reached
it with his whip-handle, and took a part
of it in, saying, &ldquo;Now I will see what it is
made of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On closely examining it, he found to his
surprise, that it was composed of an infinite
number of very small bubbles, piled one
upon another, like the little stones in a heap
of gravel. It was white and beautiful, and
in some of the biggest bubbles, Caleb could
see all the colours of the rainbow. He
wondered where this foam could come from,
and he determined to carry some of it home
to his grandmother. So he stripped off a
flat piece of birch bark from a neighbouring
tree, and took up a little of the froth upon
it, and placed it very carefully upon a rock
on the bank, where it would remain safely,
he thought, till he was ready to go home.</p>

<p>Just above where he stood was a little
waterfall in the brook. The current was
stopped by some stones and logs, and the
water tumbled over the obstruction, forming
quite a little cataract, which sparkled in the
sun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Caleb threw sticks and pieces of bark into
the water, above the fall, and watched them
as they sailed on, faster and faster, and then
pitched down the descent. Then he would
go and <i>whip</i> them into his landing, and thus
he could take them out, and sail them down
again. After amusing himself some time
in this manner, he began to wonder why Raymond
did not come, and he concluded to
take his foam, and go along. He went to
the rock and took up his birch bark; but,
to his surprise, the foam had disappeared.
He was wondering what had become of it,
when he heard across the road, and at a
little distance above him, a scrambling in
the bushes, on the side of the mountain. At
first, he was afraid; but in a moment more,
he caught a glimpse of the cow coming out
of the bushes, and supposing that Raymond
was behind, he threw down his birch bark,
and began to gallop off to meet him, lashing
the ground with his whip.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time, the cow, somewhat
worried by being driven pretty fast down
the rocks, came running out into the road,
and when she saw Caleb coming towards her,
and with such antics, began to cut capers
too. She came on, in a kind of half-frolicsome,
half-angry canter, shaking her horns;
and Caleb, before he got very near her, began
to be somewhat frightened. At first he
stopped, looking at her with alarm. Then
he began to fall back to the side of the road,
towards the brook. At this instant Raymond
appeared coming out of the bushes,
and, seeing Caleb, called out to him to stand
still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand still, Caleb, till she goes by: she
will not hurt you.&rdquo; But Caleb could not
control his fears. His little heart beat
quick, and his pale cheek grew paler. He
could not control his fears, though he knew
very well that what Raymond said must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
true. He kept retreating backwards nearer
and nearer to the brook, as the cow came
on, whipping the air, towards her to keep her
off. He was now at some little distance
above the cotton landing, and opposite to a
part of the bank where the water was deep.
Raymond perceived his danger, and as he
was now on the very brink, he shouted out
suddenly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caleb! Caleb! take care!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the sudden call only frightened poor
Caleb still more; and before the &ldquo;Take
care&rdquo; was uttered, his foot slipped, and he
slid back into the water, and sank into it
until he entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>Raymond rushed to the place, and in an
instant was in the water by his side, and
pulling Caleb out, he carried him gasping
to the shore. He wiped his face with his
handkerchief, and tried to cheer and encourage
him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Never, mind, Caleb,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it
won't hurt you. It is a warm sunny morning.&rdquo;
Caleb cried a few minutes, but,
finally, became pretty nearly calm, and Raymond
led him along towards home, sobbing
as he went, &ldquo;O dear me!&mdash;what <i>will</i> my
grandmother say?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>
<h3>TROUBLE.</h3>

<p>As Caleb walked along by the side of
Raymond, and came upon the bridge, he
was seen both by his grandmother, who happened
to be standing at the door, and also
at the same instant, by the two boys, Dwight
and David, who were just then coming home
from school. Dwight, seeing Caleb walking
along so sadly, his clothes and hair
thoroughly drenched, set up a shout, and
ran towards him over the bridge. David
was of a more quiet and sober turn, and he
followed more slowly, but with a face full of
surprise and curiosity.</p>

<p>Madam Rachel, too, perceived that her
little grandson had been in the brook, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
she said, &ldquo;Can it be possible that he has
disobeyed?&rdquo; Then, again, the next thought
was, &ldquo;Well, if he has, he has been punished
for it pretty severely, and so I will treat
him kindly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>David and Dwight came eagerly up, with
exclamations, and questions without number.
This made poor Caleb feel worse and
worse&mdash;he wanted to get home as soon as
possible, and he could not tell the boys all
the story there; and presently Raymond,
finding that he could not get by them very
well, took him up in his arms, and carried
him towards the house, David and Dwight
following behind. Caleb expected that his
grandmother would think him very much to
blame, and so, as he came near enough to
speak to her, he raised his head from Raymond's
shoulder, and began to say,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry, grandmother; but I
could not help it. I certainly could not
help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he saw at once, by his grandmother's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
pleasant-looking face, that she was not
going to find any fault with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not hurt yourself, Caleb, I
hope,&rdquo; said she, as Raymond put him
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I feel rather cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His grandmother said she would soon
warm him, and she led him into a little
bedroom, where he was accustomed to
sleep, and undressed him, talking good-humouredly
with him all the while, so as to
relieve his fears, and make him feel more
happy. She wiped him dry with soft flannel,
and gave him some clean, dry clothes,
and made him very comfortable again. She
did not ask him how he happened to fall in
the water, for she knew it would trouble
him to talk about it. So she amused him
by talking about other things, and at last
let him out again into the parlour.</p>

<p>The wetting did Caleb no injury; but
the fright and the suddenness of the plunge
gave him a shock, which, in his feeble state<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
of health, he was ill able to bear. A good
stout boy, with red cheeks and plump limbs,
would not have regarded it at all, but would
have been off to play again just as soon as
his clothes were changed. But poor Caleb
sat down in his little rocking chair by the
side of his grandmother, and began to rock
back and forth, as if he was rocking away
the memory of his troubles, while his grandmother
went on with her work.</p>

<p>Presently he stopped to listen to the
voices of Dwight and David, who were out
before the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is that the
boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I believe it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Caleb went on rocking, and the
voices died away.</p>

<p>Presently, they came nearer again. The
boys seemed to be passing down in front of
the house, with a wheelbarrow, towards the
water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother,&rdquo; said Caleb, stopping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
again, &ldquo;what do you suppose the boys are
doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;should not
you like to go and see? You can play with
them half an hour before dinner, if you
please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb did not answer, but began to rock
again. He did not seem inclined to go.</p>

<p>Soon after he heard a <i>splash</i>, as of stones
thrown into the water. Caleb started up
and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother, what <i>can</i> they be doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if you want
to know very much, you must go and
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb rose slowly, put his rocking chair
back into its place, and went to the door.
He looked down towards the bank of the
brook before the house, and saw Dwight
and David there. They had a wheelbarrow
close to the edge of the water, with a few
stones in it, some as big as Caleb's head.
Each of the boys had a stone in his hand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
which he was just throwing into the brook.
Caleb had a great desire to go down and
see what they were doing; but he felt weak
and tired, and so, after looking on a moment,
he said to himself, &ldquo;I had rather sit
down here.&rdquo; So he sat down upon the step
of the door, and looked on.</p>

<p>After the boys had thrown one or two
large stones into the water, they took hold
of the wheelbarrow, and, then, tipping
it up, the whole load slid down into the water,
close to the shore. The boys then
came back, wheeling the great wheelbarrow
up into the road.</p>

<p>They went after another load of stones,
and Caleb's curiosity was so far awakened,
that he rose slowly, and walked down towards
the place. In a few minutes, the boys
came back with their load; David wheeling,
and Dwight walking along by his side,
and pushing as well as he could, to help.
As soon as he saw Caleb, he began to call
out,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O Caleb, you were afraid of a cow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb looked sad and unhappy. David
said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not laugh at him, Dwight.
Caleb, we are building a mole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mole!&rdquo; said Caleb. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it is a kind of wharf, built out far
into the water, to make a harbour for our
shipping. We learned about it in our geography.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dwight, coming up, eagerly,
to Caleb, &ldquo;you see the current carries
all our vessels down the stream, you know,
Caleb, and we are going to build out a long
mole, out into the middle of the brook, and
that will stop our vessels; and then we are
going to make it pretty wide, so that we can
walk out upon it, and the end of it will do
for a wharf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it will be a sort of harbour for 'em,&rdquo;
said David.</p>

<p>Caleb looked quite pleased at this plan
and wanted the boys to let him help; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Dwight said he might go and help them get
their next load of stones.</p>

<p>But Caleb did not help much, although
he really tried to help. He kept getting into
the other boys' way. At last Dwight got
out of patience, and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caleb, you don't help us the least mite.
I wish you would go away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Caleb wanted to help; and Dwight
tried to make him go away. Presently, he
began to laugh at him for being afraid of a
cow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I could frighten you by <i>moo-ing</i>
at you, Caleb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb did not answer, but walked along
by the side of the wheelbarrow. David was
wheeling it; for they had now got it loaded,
and were going back to the shore of the
brook, Caleb on one side, and Dwight upon
the other. Dwight saw that Caleb hung
his head, and looked confused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Moo! moo!</i>&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>Caleb walked along silent as before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Moo! moo!</i>&rdquo; said Dwight, running
round to Caleb's side of the wheelbarrow,
and <i>moo-ing</i> close into his ear.</p>

<p>Caleb let go of the wheelbarrow, turned
around, burst into tears, and walked slowly
and sorrowfully away towards the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, now,&rdquo; said David, &ldquo;you have
made him cry. What do you want to trouble
him so for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dwight looked after Caleb, and seeing
that he was going to the house, he was
afraid that he would tell his grandmother.
So he ran after him, and began to call to
him to stop; but, before he had gone many
steps, he saw his grandmother standing at
the door of the house, and calling to them
all to come.</p>

<p>Caleb had nearly stopped crying when he
came up to his grandmother. She did not
say any thing to him about the cause of his
trouble, but asked him if he was willing to
go down cellar with Mary Anna, and help
her choose a plateful of apples for dinner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
His eye brightened at this proposal, and
Mary Anna, who was sitting at the window,
reading, rose, laid down her book, took hold
of his hand with a smile, and led him away.</p>

<p>Madam Rachel then went to her seat in
her great arm-chair, and David and Dwight
came and stood by her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, Dwight, that you wanted to
trouble Caleb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, mother,&rdquo; said Dwight, &ldquo;I only
<i>moo-ed</i> at him a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did you do it for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, only for fun, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you suppose it gave him pain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&mdash;I don't know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you suppose it gave him pleasure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said Dwight, looking down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did not you know that it gave him
pain? Now, tell me, honestly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, mother, I knew it plagued
him a little; but then I only did it for
fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Madam Rachel; &ldquo;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
that is the very thing that makes me so sorry
for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, mother?&rdquo; said Dwight in a tone
of surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because if you had given Caleb four
times as much pain for any other reason, I
should not have thought half so much of it,
as to have you trouble him for <i>fun</i>. If it
had been to do him any good, or to do any
body else any good, or from mistake, or
mere thoughtlessness, I should not have
thought so much of it; but to do it for
<i>fun</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Madam Rachel stopped, as if she
did not know what to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather think, mother, it was only
<i>thoughtlessness</i>,&rdquo; said David, by way of excusing
Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; because he knew that it gave Caleb
pain, and it was, in fact, for the very
purpose of giving him pain, that Dwight
did it. If he had been saying <i>moo</i> accidentally,
without thinking of troubling Caleb,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
that would have been thoughtlessness; but
it was not so. And what makes me most
unhappy about this,&rdquo; continued Madam
Rachel, putting her hand gently on Dwight's
head, &ldquo;is that my dear Dwight has a heart
capable under some circumstances, of taking
pleasure in the sufferings of a helpless
little child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>David and Dwight were both silent, though
they saw clearly that what their mother
said was true.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet, perhaps, you think it is a very
little thing after all,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;just
<i>moo-ing</i> at Caleb a little. The pain it gave
him was soon over. Just sending him down
cellar to get apples, made him forget it in
a moment; so that you see it is not the mischief
that is done, in this case, but the <i>spirit
of mind</i> in you, that it shews. It is a
little thing, I know; but then it is a little
symptom of a very bad disease. It is very
hard to cure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, mother,&rdquo; said Dwight, looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
up, and speaking very positively, &ldquo;I am
<i>determined</i> not to trouble Caleb any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I am afraid your <i>determinations</i>
won't reach the difficulty. As long as the
spirit of mind remains, so that you are <i>capable</i>
of taking pleasure in the sufferings of
another, your determinations not to <i>indulge</i>
the bad spirit, will not do much good. You
will forget them all, when the temptation
comes. Don't you remember how often I
have talked with you about this, and how
often you have promised not to do it, before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, mother,&rdquo; said Dwight, despondingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, you see determinations will not do
much good. As long as your heart is malicious,
the malice will come out in spite of
all your determinations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just at this moment Caleb came in, bringing
his plate of apples, with an air of great
importance and satisfaction. He had nearly
forgotten his troubles. Soon after this,
dinner was brought in, and Madam Rachel
said no more to the boys about malice.
After dinner, they went out again to play.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<h3>BUILDING THE MOLE.</h3>

<p>Caleb sat down upon the step of the door,
eating a piece of bread, while Dwight and
David returned to their work of building the
mole. They got the wheelbarrow, and loaded
it with stones.</p>

<p>Caleb sat a few minutes more at the door,
and then he went into the house, and got his
little rocking chair, and brought it out under
the elm, and sat down there, looking towards
the boys, who were at work near the
water. At last, David spied him sitting
there, and said,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;There is Caleb, sitting under the great
tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dwight looked around, and then, throwing
down the stone that he had in his hands,
he said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to go and get him to come here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he ran towards him, and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Caleb, come down here, and help
us make our mole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Caleb, shaking his head, and,
turning away a little; &ldquo;I don't want to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, do come, Caleb,&rdquo; said Dwight; &ldquo;I
won't trouble you any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Caleb: &ldquo;I am tired, and I
had rather stay here in my little chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I will carry your chair down to the
brook; and there is a beautiful place there
to sit and see us tumble in the stones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Caleb got up, and Dwight took his
chair, and they walked together down to the
shore of the brook. Dwight found a little
spot so smooth and level, that the rocking-chair
would stand very even upon it, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
it would not rock very well, for the ground
was not hard, like a floor. Caleb rested his
elbow upon the arm of his chair, and his
pale cheek in his little slender hand, and
watched the stones, as, one after another,
they fell into the brook.</p>

<p>The brook at this place, was very wide
and shallow, and the current was not very
rapid, so that they got along pretty fast;
and thus the mole advanced steadily out
into the stream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Caleb,&rdquo; said Dwight, as he stopped,
after they had tossed out all the stones
from the wheelbarrow, &ldquo;and how do you
like our mole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, not very well,&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Dwight, surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so stony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stony?&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;I don't think <i>I</i> could
walk on it very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said Dwight, &ldquo;we are going to
make the top very smooth, when we get it
done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, we are going to haul gravel on it,
and smooth it all down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can't we do it now?&rdquo; said David,
&ldquo;as we go along: and then we can wheel our
wheelbarrow out upon it, and tip our stones
in at the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said Dwight; and they accordingly
leveled the stones off on the top, and
put small stones in at all the interstices,
that is, the little spaces between the large
stones, so as to prevent the gravel from running
down through. Then they went and
got a load of gravel out of a bank pretty near,
and spread it down over the top, and it made
a good, smooth road; only, it was not trodden
down hard at first, and so it was not very
easy wheeling over it.</p>

<p>They found one difficulty, however, and
that was that the gravel rolled over each side
of the mole, and went into the water. To
prevent this, they arranged the largest stones
on each side, in a row, for the edge, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
filled in with gravel up to the edge, and thus
they gradually advanced towards the middle
of the stream, finishing the mole completely
as they went on. Caleb then said he
liked it very much, and wanted to walk on
it. So the boys let him. He went out to
the end, and stood there a minute, and then
said that he wished he had his whip there,
to whip in a stick which was sailing down a
little way off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your whip?&rdquo; said David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is hanging up on its nail,&rdquo;
said Caleb, &ldquo;I mean to go and get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Caleb walked off the mole, and went
slowly up towards the house, singing by the
way, while David and Dwight went after
another load of gravel. While they were
putting down this load, and spreading it on,
Caleb came back, looking disappointed and
sorrowful, and saying that he could not find
his whip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you put it when you had it
last?&rdquo; asked David.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I put it on the nail,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;I
always put it on the nail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, no, Caleb,&rdquo; said Dwight; &ldquo;you
must have left it about somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Caleb, shaking his head with
a positive air, &ldquo;I am <i>sure</i> I put it on my
nail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you have it last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&mdash;let me see,&rdquo; said Caleb, thinking.
&ldquo;I had it yesterday, playing horses on
the wood-pile: and then I had it this morning,&mdash;I
believe,&mdash;when I went up the brook
to meet Raymond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you left it up there, I know,&rdquo; said
Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;I am sure I put it
on my nail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not have it, Caleb,&rdquo; said David,
mildly, &ldquo;when we met you on the
bridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn't I?&rdquo; said Caleb, standing still
and trying to think.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Dwight, decidedly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would go up there with me,
and help me find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, we want to finish our mole,&rdquo; said
David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll go,&rdquo; said Dwight, &ldquo;while you, David,
get another load of gravel. Come,
Caleb,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;go and shew me where
it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Dwight and Caleb walked on. They
went down to the bridge, crossed the stream
upon it, then turned up, on the opposite
bank, and walked on until they came to the
cotton landing. Caleb then pointed to the
place where he had fallen in; and they
looked all about there, upon the bank, and
in the water, but in vain. No whip was to
be found.</p>

<p>Before they returned, they stopped a moment
at the cotton landing, and Caleb shewed
Dwight that the cotton was all made of
little bubbles. They got some of it to the
shore and examined it, and then, just as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
they were going away. Dwight exclaimed,
suddenly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is your whip, now, Caleb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb looked round, and saw that Dwight
was pointing towards the little fall or rather
great ripple of water, and there, just in
the fall, was the whip-handle floating, and
kept from drifting away by the lash, which
had got caught in the rocks. There the
handle lay, or rather hung, bobbing up and
down, and struggling as if it was trying to
get free.</p>

<p>After various attempts to liberate it, by
throwing sticks and stones at it, Dwight
took off his shoes, turned up his pantaloons
to his knees, and waded in to the place, and
after carefully extricating the whip, brought
it safely to the shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very glad I have got my whip
again,&rdquo; said Caleb, while Dwight was putting
on his shoes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad too,&rdquo; said Dwight. &ldquo;But
you told a lie about it, Caleb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lie!&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes: you said you certainly hung it up
upon the nail,&rdquo; said Dwight, as they began
to walk along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought I did,&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That makes no difference. You did not
say you <i>thought</i> you hung it up, but that you
were sure you did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I certainly thought I did,&rdquo; said
Caleb; &ldquo;and I am sure it wasn't a lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dwight insisted that it was, and Caleb determined
to ask his grandmother.</p>

<p>They returned to the mole.</p>

<p>It was not long after this, that David, on
looking towards the house, called out that
his mother was coming. It was true. She
put on her bonnet, and was coming slowly
down to the brook, to see how the boys got
on with their work. They were rejoiced to
see her coming. They took Caleb's chair,
and laid it down upon its side, and then put
one of the side-pieces of the wheelbarrow
upon it with the clean side up; and this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
made quite a comfortable seat for her, though
it was a little unsteady. She sat down upon
it, and made a good many enquiries about
their plan and the progress of the work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that is a capital
plan, and you will have a great eddy
above your mole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An eddy!&rdquo; said Dwight, &ldquo;what is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the water coming down, will strike
upon the outer end of your mole, and be
turned in towards the shore, and then will
go round, and will come into the stream
again. There, you can see it is beginning
to run so already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the boys looked above the mole, and
they saw the little bubbles that were floating
in the water, sailing round and round slowly,
in a small circle, between the upper side of
the mole and the shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you get it built away out,&rdquo; said
Madam Rachel, &ldquo;there will be quite a
whirlpool; you might call it the Maelstrom.
There, you see, Caleb can have a little har<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>bour
up there on the shore, and one of you
can go out to the end of the mole, and put
a little ship into the water, and the eddy will
carry it round to him. Then he can take
out the cargo, and put in a new one, and
then set the ship in the water, and the current
will carry it back again, round on the
other side of the whirlpool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys were very much delighted at
this prospect, and they determined to build
out the mole very far, so as to have &ldquo;a great
sweep,&rdquo; as Dwight called it, in the eddy.
Caleb went out upon the part of the mole
which was finished, and put in a piece of
wood, and watched it with great delight as
it slowly sailed round.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>
<h3>A DISCUSSION.</h3>

<p>While Caleb stood upon the mole, he began
to whip the water; and, in doing so, he
spattered David and Dwight a little.</p>

<p>Dwight said, &ldquo;Take care, Caleb&mdash;don't
spatter us;&rdquo; and he went up to him, and was
going gently to take hold of his whip, to
take it away. &ldquo;Let me have the whip,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Caleb, holding it firmly, &ldquo;I
want it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let go of it, Dwight,&rdquo; said Madam
Rachel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, mother, he ought to let me have
it, for I went and got it for him. He would
not have had it at all without me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not take it by violence,&rdquo; said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
his mother, &ldquo;if you have ever so good a right
to it. But did you get it for him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother; and he told a lie about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, Dwight,&rdquo; said his mother, &ldquo;you
ought not to say so. I can't think Caleb
would tell a lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did, mother; he said he was sure
he hung it up, when, after all, he dropped it
in the water; and we agreed to leave it to
you if that was not telling a lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know, Caleb, when you said
you hung it up, that you had really left it in
the water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, grandmother,&rdquo; said Caleb, very
earnestly; &ldquo;I really thought I had hung
it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it was not telling a <i>lie</i>, Dwight. A
lie is told with an intention to deceive. To
make it a lie it is necessary that the person
who says a thing, must <i>know distinctly</i> at
the time that he says it, that it is not true;
and he must say it with the particular intention
to deceive. Now, Caleb did not do
this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, mother,&rdquo; said Dwight, &ldquo;I am
sure you have told us a good many times
that we must never say any thing unless we
are sure it is true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I have. I admit that Caleb did
wrong in saying so positively that he had
hung his whip up, when he did not know
certainly that he had. But this does not
prove that it was telling a lie. You know
there are a great many other faults besides
telling lies; and this is one of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you call it, mother?&rdquo; said
David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said she, hesitating. &ldquo;It
is a very common fault,&mdash;asserting a thing
positively, when you do not know whether
it is true or not. But if you <i>think</i> it is true,
even if you have no proper grounds for
thinking so, and are entirely mistaken, it is
not telling a lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I once knew
a case where one boy was justly punished
for falsehood when what he said was true;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and another was rewarded for his truth,
when what he said was false.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, mother?&rdquo; said Dwight and David
together, with great surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Madam Rachel; &ldquo;the case
was this. They were farmers' boys, and
they wanted to go into the barn, and play
upon the hay. Their father told them they
might go, but charged them to be careful
to shut the door after them in going in, so
as not to let the colt get out. So the boys
ran off to the barn in high glee, and were
so eager to get upon the hay, that they forgot
altogether to shut the door. When they
came down they found the door open, and
to their great alarm, the colt was nowhere
to be seen. Josy, one of the boys, said,
'Let us shut the door now, and not tell
father that we let the colt out, and he will
think somebody else did it.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;'No,' said James, the other, 'let us tell
the truth.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;So about an hour afterwards, Josy went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
into the house, and his father said, 'Josy,
did you let the colt out?'</p>

<p>&ldquo;'No, sir,' said Josy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not long after he met James.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'James,' said he, 'you had a fine time
upon the hay, I suppose. I hope you did
not let the colt out.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;James hung his head, and said, 'Why,
yes, sir, we did. We forgot to shut the
door, and so he got away.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, which of these boys, do you suppose,
was guilty of telling a lie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Josy, certainly,&rdquo; said David,
Dwight, and Caleb, all together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and yet the colt had not got
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hadn't he?&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he was safely coiled up in a corner
upon some hay, out of sight; and there the
farmer found him safe and sound, when he
went in to look. But did that make any
difference in Josy's guilt, do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mother,&rdquo; said Dwight. David, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the same time shook his head, shewing that
he entertained the same opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it did not,&rdquo; continued Madam
Rachel, &ldquo;and the farmer thought so too;
for he very properly punished Josy, and rewarded
James.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dwight seemed to assent to this rather
reluctantly, as if he was almost sorry that
Caleb had not been proved guilty of telling
a lie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, mother,&rdquo; he said presently, with
a more lively tone, &ldquo;at any rate he disobeyed
you; for you told him not to go near the
brook where the bank was high; and he did,
or else he never would have fallen in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I could not help it,&rdquo; said Caleb,
&ldquo;the cow frightened me so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you could help it,&rdquo; said Dwight;
&ldquo;for the cow did not come up and push
you; you walked back yourself, of your own
accord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madam Rachel observed that Caleb appeared
more pale and languid than usual;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
and this new charge which Dwight brought
against him, made him more sad and melancholy
still.</p>

<p>Madam Rachel accordingly then said she
would not talk any more about it then, for
she must go in, and she asked Caleb whether
he would rather go in with her, or remain out
there with the boys. He said he would rather
go in. So he took hold of Madam Rachel's
hand, and walked along by her side.
David said he would bring his rocking-chair
for him, when he and Dwight should
come in.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE STORY OF BLIND SAMUEL.</h3>

<p>Madam Rachel went into the house, and
sat down in her large rocking-chair, by a
window, in a back parlour that looked out
upon a little garden, and began to sew.
Caleb played around a little while, rather
languidly, and at last came up to his grandmother,
and leaning upon her lap, asked her
if she would not take him up, and rock
him a little. She could not help pitying
him, he looked so feeble and sad; and she
accordingly laid down her work, and lifted
him up,&mdash;he was not heavy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well Caleb, you have not asked me to
take you up, and tell you a story so, for a
long time. This is the way I used to do
when you were quite a little boy; only then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
you used to kneel in my lap, and lay your
head upon my shoulder, so that my mouth
was close to your ear. But you are too big
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb smiled a little, for he was glad to
find that he was growing big; but it was
rather a faint and sad smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don't grow any stronger, grandmother,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;I wish I was well and
strong, like the other boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't know what would be best for
you, my little Caleb. God leads you along
in his own way through life, and you must
go patiently and pleasantly on, just where
he thinks best. You are like blind Samuel,
going through the woods with his
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was that, grandmother?&rdquo; said he,
sitting up, and turning round to look at
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sit still,&rdquo; said she, gently laying
him back again, &ldquo;and I will tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Samuel was a blind boy. He had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
away, and was now going home with his father.
His father led him, and he walked
along by his side. Presently, they came
to a large brook, and, before they got near
it, they heard it roaring. His father said,
'Samuel, I think there is a freshet.' 'I
think so too,' said Samuel, 'for I hear the
water roaring.' When they came in sight
of the stream, his father said, 'Yes, Samuel,
there has been a great freshet, and the
bridge is carried away.' 'And what shall
we do now?' said Samuel. 'Why we must
go round by the path through the woods.'
'That will be bad for me,' said Samuel
'But I will lead you,' said his father, 'all
the way; just trust every thing to me.'
'Yes, father,' said Samuel, 'I will.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;So his father took a string out of his
pocket, and gave one end of it to Samuel.
'There, Samuel,' said he, 'take hold of that,
and that will guide you; and walk directly
after me.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long was the string?&rdquo; said Caleb.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O not very long,&rdquo; replied Madam Rachel;
&ldquo;so as just to let him walk a step or
two behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After he had walked on a short distance,
he said, 'Father, I wish you would let me
take hold of your hand.' 'But you said,'
replied his father, 'that you would trust
every thing to me.' 'So I will, father,'
said Samuel; 'but I do wish you would let
me take hold of your hand, instead of this
string.' 'Very well,' said his father, 'you
may try <i>your</i> way.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Samuel came and took hold of his
father's hand, and tried to walk along by his
father's side. But the path was narrow;
there was not more than room for one, and
though his father walked as far on one side
as possible, yet Samuel had not room
enough. The branches scratched his face,
and he stumbled continually upon roots
and stones. At length he said, 'Father,
you know best. I will take hold of the
string, and walk behind.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So, after that, he was patient and submissive,
and followed his father wherever he
led. After a time his father saw a serpent
in the road directly before them. So he
turned aside, to go round by a compass in
the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A compass?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said his grandmother; &ldquo;that is
a round-about way. But it was very rough
and stony. Presently, Samuel stopped and
said, 'Father, it seems to me it is pretty
stony; haven't we got out of the path?'</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Yes,' said his father; 'but you promised
to be patient and submissive, and
trust every thing to me.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Well,' said Samuel, 'you know best,
and I will follow.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he walked on again. When they
had got by, his father told him that the reason
why he had gone out of the road was,
that there was a serpent there. And so,
when God leads us in a difficult way, Caleb,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
that we don't understand at the time, we often
see the reason of it afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb did not answer, and Madam Rachel
went on with her story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By and by, his father came within the
sound of the brook again, and stopped a minute
or two, and then he told Samuel that
he should have to leave him a short time,
and that he might sit down upon a log, and
wait until he came back. 'But, father,'
said Samuel, 'I don't want to be left alone
here in the woods, in the dark.' 'It is not
dark,' said his father. 'It is all dark to
me,' said Samuel. 'I know it is,' said his
father, 'and I am very sorry; but you promised
to leave every thing to me, and be
obedient and submissive.' 'So I will, father;
you know best, and I will do just as
you say.' So Samuel sat down upon the log,
and his father went away. He was a little
terrified by the solitude, and the darkness,
and the roaring of the water; but he trusted
to his father, and was still.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;By and by, he heard a noise as of something
heavy falling into the water. He was
frightened, for he thought it was his father.
But it was not his father. What do you
think it was, Caleb?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb did not answer. Madam Rachel
looked down to see why he did not speak,
and as she moved him a little, so as to see
his face, his head rolled over to one side;
and, in short, Madam Rachel found that he
was fast asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little fellow!&rdquo; said she; and she
rose carefully, and carried him to the bed, and
laid him down. He opened his eyes a moment,
when his cheek came in contact with
the cool pillow, but turned his face over immediately,
shut his eyes again, and was
soon in a sound sleep.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<h3>ENGINEERING.</h3>

<p>When Caleb awoke it was almost evening.
The rays of the setting sun were shining in
at the window. Caleb opened his eyes, and,
after lying still a few moments, began to
sing. He thought it was morning, and that
it was time for him to get up. Presently,
however, he observed that the sun was shining
in at the wrong window for morning:
then he noticed that he was not undressed;
and, finally, he thought it must be night;
but he could not think how he came to be
asleep there at that time.</p>

<p>Caleb went out into the parlour. David
and Dwight were just putting the chairs
around the tea table. At tea time, the boys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
talked a good deal about the mole, and they
asked Mary Anna if she would help them
rig some vessels to sail in the Maelstrom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sail in the Maelstrom!&rdquo; said Mary
Anna; &ldquo;whoever heard of sailing in the
Maelstrom? That is a great whirlpool,
which swallows up ships; they never sail
in it. You had better call it the Gulf
Stream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dwight, &ldquo;we will; and
will you help us rig some vessels?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mary Anna, &ldquo;when you get
the mole done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Anna was a beautiful girl, about
seventeen years old, with a mild and gentle
expression of countenance, and very pleasant
tone of voice. She helped the children
in all their plays, and they were always pleased
when she was with them. She had great
stores of pasteboard and coloured papers, to
make boxes, and portfolios, and little pocket-books,
and wallets of; and she had a
paint-box, and pencils, and drawing-books,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
and portfolios of pictures and drawing
lessons.</p>

<p>She rigged the boys' vessels, and covered
their balls, and made them beautiful flags
and banners out of her pieces of coloured
silk. She advised them to have a flag-staff
out at the end of the mole, as they generally
have on all fortifications and national
works. She told them she would make
them a handsome flag for the purpose.</p>

<p>After tea she went down with them to
see the works. She seemed to like the mole
very much. The whirlpool was moving
very regularly, and she advised them to build
the mole out pretty far.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dwight; &ldquo;and we are going
to have a piece across up and down the
stream, at the end of it, so as to make a T
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you had better make a Y of it,&rdquo;
said Mary Anna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Y!&rdquo; said Dwight, &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why instead of having the end piece<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
go straight across the end of the mole, let
the two parts of it branch out into the
stream, one upwards and the other down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What good will that do?&rdquo; said David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, if you make it straight like a T,
the current will run directly along the outer
edge of it, and so your vessels will not stay
there. But if you have it Y-shaped, there
will be a little sort of harbour in the crotch,
where your vessels can lie quietly, while
the current flows along by, out beyond the
forks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be excellent,&rdquo; said Dwight,
clapping his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the upper
part of the Y will run out obliquely into the
stream, and so turn more of the current into
your eddy, and make the whirlpool larger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and we will make it so,&rdquo; said
David; &ldquo;and then it will be an excellent
mole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mary Anna, &ldquo;there will be
all sorts of water around it;&mdash;a whirlpool<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
above, a little harbour in the crotch, a current
in front, and still water below. It will
be as good a place for sailing boats as I ever
saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the twilight was coming on, and
they all soon returned to the house.</p>

<p>Madam Rachel had a little double-bedroom,
as it was called, where she slept. It
was called a double-bedroom, because it
consisted, in fact, of two small rooms, with
a large arched opening between them, without
any door. In one room was the bed,
which moved in and out on little trucks, for
Caleb. In the other room was a table in
the middle, with books and papers upon it.
There was a window in one side, and opposite
the arched opening which led to the
bedroom was a small sofa.</p>

<p>Now, it was Madam Rachel's custom
every evening, before the children went to
bed, to take them into her bedroom, and
hear them read a few verses of the Bible;
and then she would explain the verses, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
talk with them a little about what had occurred
during the day, and give them good
advice and good instruction. At such
times the children usually sat upon the sofa,
on one side of the table, and Madam Rachel
took her seat on the other side of the table,
in the chair, so as to face them. The children
generally liked this very much; and
yet she very seldom told them any stories
at these times. It was almost all reasonings
and explanations; and yet the children
liked it very much.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE SOFA.</h3>

<p>The boys took their places on the sofa, and
afterwards laid their books upon the table.
After that Madam Rachel began to talk
about the occurrences of the day, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are two or three things, boys,
that I have been keeping to talk with you
about this evening. One is the question
you asked, Dwight, about Caleb's disobeying
me, when he fell into the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother,&rdquo; said Dwight, looking up
at once, very eagerly; &ldquo;you told him never
to go near the bank; and yet he went, and
so he fell in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I could not help it,&rdquo; said Caleb.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, mother, he certainly could
help it; for he walked there himself of his
own accord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well; that is the question for us to
consider; but, first, we must all be in a proper
state of mind to consider it, or else it will
do us no good. Now, Dwight, I am going
to ask you a question, and I want to have
you answer it honestly:&mdash;Which way do you
wish to have this question, about Caleb's
disobedience, decided?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&mdash;I don't know,&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose I should come to the conclusion
that Caleb did right, and should prove it by
arguments, should you feel a little glad, or
a little sorry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dwight hung his head, and seemed somewhat
confused, but said, doubtfully, that he
did not know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I think, myself,&rdquo; said his mother,
&ldquo;that you have a secret wish to have it appear
that Caleb is guilty of disobedience.
You said he disobeyed, at first, from unkind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
feelings, which you seemed to feel towards
him at the moment; and now, I suppose,
you wish to adhere to it, so as to get the
victory. Now, honestly, isn't it so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dwight did not answer at first. He looked
somewhat ashamed. Presently, however,
he concluded, that it was best to be frank
and honest; so he looked up and acknowledged
that it was so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said his mother; &ldquo;and while you
are under the influence of such a prejudice,
it would do no good for us to discuss the
subject, for you would not be convinced;
so you had better give it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madam Rachel saw, while she was speaking,
that Dwight did not look sullen and
dissatisfied, but good-natured and pleasant;
and so she knew that he had concluded to
listen, candidly, to what she had to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that Caleb was not to blame at
all,&rdquo; said Madam Rachel, &ldquo;for two reasons.
One is, that he was probably overwhelmed
with terror. To be sure, as you say, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
cow did not push him. He walked himself,&mdash;yet
still he was <i>impelled</i> as strongly as if
he had been pushed, though in a different
manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there is another reason why Caleb
is innocent of any disobedience. When I
told him that he must not go to the high
banks, I did not mean that he <i>never</i> must
go, <i>in any case whatever</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you <i>said</i> he never must,&rdquo; said
David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume I did say so, and I made no
exceptions; but still some exceptions are
always <i>implied</i> in such a case. In all commands,
however positive they may be, there
is always some exception implied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, mother?&rdquo; said Dwight with surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; said his mother. &ldquo;Suppose,
for instance, that I were to tell you to sit
down by the parlour fire, and study a lesson,
and not to get out of your chair on any
account. And suppose that, after I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
gone and left you, the fire should fall down,
and some coals roll out upon the floor, would
it not be your duty to get up, and brush them
back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So in all cases, very extreme and extraordinary
occurrences, that could not, by
possibility, have been considered, make exceptions.
And Caleb, thinking, as he did,
that he was in great danger from the cow, if
he had thought of my command at all, he
would have done perfectly right to have
considered so extraordinary a case an exception,
and so have retreated towards the brook,
notwithstanding my commands. And now
that question is settled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here little Caleb, who had been sitting
up very straight, and looking eagerly at his
grandmother and at the other boys, during
the progress of the conversation, drew a long
breath, and leaned back against the sofa, as
if he felt a good deal relieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Dwight, there is one thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
I have seen in you to-day, which gave me
a great deal of pleasure, and another which
gave me pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, mother,&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, after I talked with you at noon,
about teasing Caleb, you began to treat
him very kindly. That gave me a great
deal of pleasure. I saw that your heart was
somewhat changed in regard to Caleb; for
you seemed to take pleasure in making him
happy, while before you took delight in
making him miserable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dwight looked gratified and pleased
while his mother was saying these things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But then, in the course of the afternoon,&rdquo;
she continued, &ldquo;the old malignant
heart seemed to come back again. When
I came down to see the mole, I found you
in such a state of mind as to take pleasure
in Caleb's suffering. You wanted to prove
that he had told a lie, and looked disappointed
when I shewed you that he had not.
Then you wanted to prove he had disobeyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
me, when, after all, you knew very well that
he had not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, mother,&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dwight, I am very sorry to have
to say so; but you undoubtedly had no real
belief that Caleb had done wrong. Suppose
I had told you I was going to punish him
for disobeying me in retreating to the brook,
should you have thought that it would have
been right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no, mother,&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would have been shocked at such
an idea. And now don't you see that all
your attempts to prove that he had done
wrong, was only the effect of the ill-will
you felt towards him at the time. It was
malice triumphing over your judgment and
your sense of right and wrong. I told you,
you know, that your resolutions would not
reach the case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, mother, I am <i>determined</i>,&rdquo; said
Dwight, very deliberatively and positively,
&ldquo;that I <i>never</i> will tease or trouble Caleb
any more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The evil is not so much in teasing and
troubling Caleb, as in having a heart capable
of taking any pleasure in it. That is the
great difficulty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, mother, I am determined I never
will feel any pleasure in his trouble again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid that won't depend altogether
upon the determination you make. For instance,
when you went to Caleb to-day, and
kindly tried to persuade him to go down,
and offered to carry his rocking-chair for
him, your heart was then in a state of love
towards him. Do you think you could
then, by determination, have changed it
from love to hate, and begun to take pleasure
in teasing him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dwight remembered how kindly and pleasantly
he had felt towards Caleb at that
time, and he thought that it would have
been impossible for him then to have found
any pleasure in tormenting him; and so he
said, &ldquo;No, mother, I could not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so, when you are angry with a per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>son,
and your heart is in a state of ill-will
and malice towards him, does it seem to you
that you can merely by a determination
change it all at once, and begin to be
filled with love, so as to feel pleasure in his
happiness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dwight was silent at first; he presently
answered, faintly, that he could not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you cannot change your heart
by your mere determination at the time, you
certainly cannot by making one general
determination, now beforehand, for all time
to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dwight saw his helpless condition, and
sighed. After a pause, he said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, it seems to me you are discouraging
me from trying to be a better boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Dwight; but I don't want you to
depend on false hopes that must only end
in your disappointment. Your determination
will help in not indulging the bad feelings;
but I want to have your heart changed
so that you could not possibly <i>have</i> such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
feelings. I hope mine is. I once shewed
the same spirit that you do; but now I don't
think it would be possible for me to take
any pleasure in teasing Caleb, or you, or
David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; added Madam Rachel, &ldquo;that
God will give you a benevolent and tender
heart, so that there shall be no <i>tendency</i> in
you to do wrong. He will change yours, if
you pray to him to do it. In fact, I hope,
and sometimes I almost believe, that he has
begun. I do not think you would have gone
to Caleb to-day so pleasantly, and acknowledged
your fault, as you did by your actions,
and felt so totally different from what you
had done, if God had not wrought some
change in you. I have very often talked
with children about such faults, as plainly
and kindly as I did with you, and it produced
no effect. When they went away, I
found, by their looks and actions afterwards,
that their hearts were not changed
at all. And so, Dwight,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
not been saying this to discourage you, but
to make you feel that you need a greater
change than you can accomplish, and so to
lead you to God that you may throw yourself
upon him, and ask him, not merely to
help you in your determinations not to act
out your bad feelings, but to change the
very nature of them, or rather, to carry on
the change, which I hope he has begun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dwight remembered, while his mother
was talking, how full his heart had been of
kindness and love to Caleb, while he was
helping him that afternoon, and he perceived
clearly that he had not produced that
state of mind by any of his own determinations
that he would feel so before he actually
did. He remembered how happy he had
been at that time, and how discontented
and miserable after he had been troubling
Caleb; and he had a feeling of strong desire
that God would change his heart, and
make him altogether and always benevolent
and kind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, it happened that Caleb had not understood
this conversation very well, and he
began to be weary and uneasy. Besides
just about this time he began to recollect
something about his grandmother's beginning
a story for him, when she took him up
in her lap, after he came in from the mole.
So, when he noticed that there was a pause
in the conversation, he said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother, you promised to tell me
a story about blind Samuel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I did,&rdquo; said his grandmother smiling,
&ldquo;and I began it; but before I got through
you got fast asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>David and Dwight laughed, and so in fact
did Caleb; and Madam Rachel then said
that if he would tell David and Dwight
the story as far as she had gone, she would
finish it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;I will. Once there
was a blind boy, and his name was Samuel;
and, you see, he was going through the
woods, and his father was with him. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
his father walked along, and he walked
along, and it was stony, and he said he
would do just what his father said, because
his father knew best,&mdash;and&mdash;and so he took
hold of the string again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What string?&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it was his father's string,&rdquo; said
Caleb, eagerly, looking up into Dwight's
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he have a string for?&rdquo; said
David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why to lead him along by,&rdquo; said
Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but why did not he take hold of
his father's hand?&rdquo; asked Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&mdash;why,&mdash;there was a snake in the
road, I believe,&mdash;wasn't there, grandmother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His grandmother smiled,&mdash;for Caleb had
evidently got bewildered, in his drowsiness,
so that he had not a very distinct recollection
of the story. She, therefore, began
again, and told the whole. When she got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
to the place where she left off before, that
is, to the place Samuel heard a splash in the
water, Dwight started up, and asked,
eagerly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A stone, I suppose,&rdquo; said David,
coolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Madam Rachel, &ldquo;it was only
the end of the stem of a small tree, which
Samuel's father was trying to fix across the
brook, so that he could lead his blind boy
over. It was lying upon the ground, and
he took it and raised it upon its end, near
the edge of the bank, on one side, and then
let it fall over, in hopes that the other end
would fall upon the opposite bank. But it
did not happen to fall straight across, and
so the end fell into the water, and this was
the noise that Samuel heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He drew the stick back again, and then
contrived to raise it on its end once more;
and this time he was more successful. It
fell across, and so extended from bank to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
bank. In a few minutes he succeeded in
getting another by its side, and then he
came back to Samuel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Samuel,' said he, 'I have built a
bridge.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;'A bridge!' said Samuel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Yes,' said he, 'a sort of a bridge; and
now I am going to try to lead you over.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;'But, father, I am afraid.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;'You said you would trust yourself
entirely to me, and go wherever I should
say.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Well, father,' said Samuel, 'I will.
You know best, after all.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Samuel took hold of his father's
hand, and, with slow, and very careful
steps, he got over the roaring torrent, and
then they soon came out into a broad smooth
road, and so got safely home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Caleb,&rdquo; continued Madam Rachel,
after she had finished her story, &ldquo;do
you remember what I meant to teach you
by this story<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Grandmother; you said that I was
like blind Samuel, and that God knew what
was best for me, and that I must let him
lead me wherever he pleases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and what was it that you said that
reminded me to tell you the story?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said that I wished that I was well and
strong, like the other boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said his grandmother, &ldquo;I do not
think you said it in a fretful or impatient
spirit; but I thought that this story of
Samuel would help to keep you patient
and contented.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, grandmother, it does,&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE CART RIDE.</h3>

<p>A week after this, Caleb had his whip to
mend. He had broken off the lash, by whipping
in sticks and little pieces of drift-wood
to the mole. David and Dwight worked a
little every day upon the mole, and had carried
it out pretty far into the stream, and
had almost finished the lower branches of
the Y. So, one morning, after the boys had
gone to school, and Caleb had had his reading
lesson, he sat down upon the steps of
the door, behind the house, and began to
tie on his lash with a piece of twine which
Mary Anna had given him.</p>

<p>Behind the house where Caleb's grandmother
lived, there was a lane which led to
the pasture. At the head of the lane, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
you entered it from the yard, were a pair of
bars. While Caleb was mending his whip,
he accidentally looked up, and noticed that
the bars were down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, Mr. Raymond,&rdquo; said Caleb,
talking to himself, as he went on winding
his twine round and round the whip-handle;
&ldquo;for once in your life, you have been careless.
You have left your bars down. Now
we shall have the cattle all let out, unless I
go and stop the mischief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb thought he would go and put the
bars up again, as soon as he had tied the
ends of his twine; but before he got quite
ready, he heard a noise, as of something
coming in the lane. He could not see down
the lane far, from the place where he sat,
for the barn was in the way. But he wondered
what could be coming, and he looked
towards the bars, and sat waiting for it to
appear.</p>

<p>In a moment, the head and horns of a
great ox came into view, and, immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
after, the body of the ox himself, walking
slowly along towards the bars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;there comes
Lion, and he'll get away.&rdquo; So he jumped
up, and ran towards the ox a few steps,
brandishing his whip, and shouting out to
drive him back. Old Lion, however, seemed
to pay no attention, but came steadily
forward, stepping carefully over the ends of
the bars, and then, advancing a little way
into the yard, began quietly to feed upon
the grass. Before Caleb got over his surprise
at the entire indifference which old
Lion seemed to feel towards him and his
whip, he heard the bars rattling again, and
looking there, he saw Star, Lion's mate,
following on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O dear me,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;what shall I
do? All our oxen are getting away. I'll
run and call Raymond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he began to shout out &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Raymond</span>,&rdquo;
as loud as he could call; and immediately
afterwards, he heard Raymond's voice an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>swering
just down the lane and, looking
that way, he saw him coming over the bars
himself, as if he had been following the
oxen along up the lane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raymond, Raymond,&rdquo; he cried out,
&ldquo;come quiet; all your oxen are getting
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, no,&rdquo; said Raymond, quietly, as he
was putting up the bars after the oxen, &ldquo;they
cannot get away&mdash;I have fastened the outer
gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Caleb looked around and observed
that the outer gate was fastened, so that they
could not get out of the yard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, very well,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I did not
know you were driving them up;&rdquo; and so
he quietly returned to his seat, and went on
playing with his whip. Raymond, in the
mean time, proceeded to yoke up the cattle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raymond,&rdquo; said Caleb, at length,
&ldquo;where are you going with the cattle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out into the woods,&rdquo; said Raymond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do in the woods?&rdquo;
said Caleb.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to make a piece of fence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I go with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think you can help me much
about the fence,&rdquo; said Raymond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can pull bushes along,&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>Raymond made no reply, but began to
drive the oxen towards a cart that was standing
in a corner of the yard, and, after a
few minutes, Caleb renewed his request.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raymond, I wish you would let me go
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;it is just as your grandmother
says,&rdquo; replied Raymond.</p>

<p>So Caleb ran to ask his grandmother;
and she came to the window, and enquired
of Raymond how long he expected to be
gone. He said it would take him more
than half a day to make the piece of fence,
and he was going to take his dinner with
him. This was an objection to Caleb's
going; but yet his grandmother concluded
on the whole to consent. So they put up
some bread and butter, and some apples,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
with Raymond's dinner, for Caleb. These
things were all put in paper parcels, and
the parcels put into a bag, which was thrown
into the bottom of the cart.</p>

<p>Then Caleb wanted to take his hatchet.</p>

<p>His grandmother thought it would not
be safe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll be <i>very</i> careful,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;and if I
don't have my hatchet, how can I help to
make the fence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raymond smiled, and Madam Rachel
seemed at a loss to know what to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won't do,&mdash;will it Raymond?&rdquo; said
she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might cut himself,&rdquo; said Raymond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is a small key-hole saw in
the barn, that I filed up the other day.
Perhaps he might have that, to saw the
bushes down with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you saw, Caleb?&rdquo; said his grandmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not very well,&rdquo; said Caleb, looking
somewhat disappointed; &ldquo;the saw sticks
so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can set it pretty rank,&rdquo; said Raymond,
speaking to Madam Rachel at the
window, &ldquo;and then, I think, he can make
it run smooth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madam Rachel did not understand what
Raymond meant by <i>setting it rank</i>, and so
she said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;How will that help it, Raymond?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, then it will cut a wide kerf,&rdquo;
said Raymond, &ldquo;and so the back will follow
in easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not understand from this much
better than she did before; but, as <i>she</i> had
great confidence in Raymond, she concluded
to let him manage in his own way. She
accordingly told him that he might fix the
saw, and take Caleb with him.</p>

<p>So Raymond went out into the barn, and
took down the saw from a nail. The teeth
looked bright and sharp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Raymond, how sharp it looks.
And the teeth are of different shape from
what they were before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Raymond, &ldquo;I have made a
cutting saw of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cutting saw?&rdquo; said Caleb. &ldquo;Can
you <i>cut</i> with a saw? I thought they always
<i>sawed</i> with a saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean, cut across the grain,&rdquo; said
Raymond, smiling. &ldquo;When a saw is filed
so as to saw <i>along</i> the board, then it is called
a <i>splitting</i> saw; but when it is to saw
<i>across</i> the board, then I call it a <i>cutting</i> saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb looked carefully at the teeth, so as
to see how the teeth of a cutting saw were
shaped. And while he looked on, he observed
that Raymond had a little instrument in
his hand, and he took hold of the first tooth
of the saw with it, and bent it over a little
to one side, and then he took hold of the
next one, and bent it over to the other side;
and so he went on, bending them alternately
to the right and left, until he passed
along from one end of the saw to the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that is set pretty
rank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; said Caleb,
as he followed Raymond out of the barn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the teeth are set off, a good way,
each side, and it will cut a good wide kerf;
and so your saw will run easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the cart.
Raymond took hold of Caleb under the
arms, and jumped him up into the cart behind,
and then handed him his saw. Then
he put in an axe and an iron bar for himself,
and one or two spare chains; and then
he went to open the great gate. Just at
this moment, Mary Anna appeared at the
window, and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caleb, are you going into the woods?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, if you see any good, smooth birch
bark, won't you bring me home some!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Caleb; and then Raymond
opened the gate, and started the oxen
on. Caleb stood up in front, holding on by
a stake, and wondering all the while what
Raymond could mean by a <i>kerf</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>One would think that he might have
known by the connection in which Raymond
used it,&mdash;for he said that he had bent the
teeth out so as to make the saw cut a good
wide <i>kerf</i>, and so he might have supposed
that the kerf was the cut in the wood which
a saw makes in going in. The reason why
boys find it so difficult to saw, is because
the teeth do not generally spread very much,
and so the kerf is narrow. Still, the back
of the saw would run in it well enough,
without sticking, if they were to saw perfectly
straight. But they generally make the saw
twist or wind a little, and then the back of
the saw rubs upon one side or the other; and
sticks. Now, Raymond's plan was to make
the teeth set off, each side, so far as to make
the kerf very wide, and then he thought that
Caleb would be able to make it go, especially
as the saw was very narrow.</p>

<p>Raymond got into the cart, and took his
seat upon a board which passed across from
side to side, and they rode along.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>They reached, at length, a place where
there was a small cart path leading off from
the main road into the woods. Raymond
turned off into this path; but it was so narrow
that both he and Caleb had sometimes
to lean away to one side or the other to
avoid the bushes. At length he stopped
and unfastened the oxen from the tongue.
When all was right he started the oxen on
before him, Caleb trotting on behind with
his saw in his hand.</p>

<p>Presently they struck off from the cart
path directly into the woods, and in a few
minutes came to the place where the fence
was to be made.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE FIRE.</h3>

<p>Raymond let the cattle browse about, while
he went to work, cutting down some small,
but yet pretty tall and bushy trees. He
then brought up the team, and hooked a
long chain into the ring which hung down
from the middle of the yoke, upon the under
side. The end of the chain trailed upon
the ground, as the oxen came along, and
Caleb was very much interested to see how
they would trample along, any where, among
the rocks, roots, mire, logs, bushes, stumps,
and, in fact, over and through almost any
thing, chewing their cud all the time,
patient and unconcerned. When they
were brought up near to one of the trees
that had been cut down, Raymond would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
hook the chain around the butt end of it,
and then, at his command, they would drag
it out of its place in the line of the fence.
After looking on for some time, Caleb began
to think that he would go to work; and
he went to a little tree, with a stem about
as big round as his arm, and began to saw
away upon it. He found that the saw would
run very well indeed; and in a short time,
he got the tree off, and then undertook to
drag it to the fence.</p>

<p>Raymond was always a very silent man;
he seldom spoke, unless to answer a question;
and while Caleb had been watching
him, when he first began to work, instead
of talking with Caleb, as Caleb would have
desired, he was all the time singing,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do, Re, Mi, <ins class="hover" title="This was missing
from the original">Fa</ins> Sol, La, Si, Do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The truth was, that Raymond had just
begun to go to a singing school, and he was
taking this opportunity to rise and fall the
notes, as he called it. When Caleb asked
him any question about his work, he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
just answer it in a few words, and then, a
minute after, begin again with his '<i>Do</i>, <i>Re</i>,
<i>Mi</i>,' and all the rest.</p>

<p>Caleb became tired of this singing; and
when, at length, his tree got wedged fast,
so that he could not move it any farther, he
sat down discouraged upon a log, and looked
anxiously towards Raymond, as if he
wished that he would come and help him.</p>

<p>Raymond had just hooked his chain to
another tree, and taking up his goad stick,
called out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha', Star! ha', Lion!&rdquo; and then as his
oxen started on, he followed them with
his&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do, <ins class="hover" title="original read
Be">Re,</ins> Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si, Do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Caleb, with a deep
sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do, Si, La, Sol, Fa, Mi, Re, Do,&rdquo;
sang Raymond, coming down the scale.</p>

<p>Caleb got up, and walked along towards
Raymond a little way, and called out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raymond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Raymond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do you think you shall be done
singing that tune?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raymond smiled, and asked &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Caleb, in rather a timid
voice, &ldquo;I don't think it is a very pretty
tune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you?&rdquo; said Raymond. &ldquo;Well,
I don't admire it much myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what do you sing it so much, for,
Raymond?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, that's my lesson,&rdquo; said Raymond,
&ldquo;but how does your saw do, Caleb?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well; only I can't get my tree
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you want to get it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, out to the fence,&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better not try to make a fence.
You had better build a fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have not got any fire to light it
with?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Raymond, &ldquo;I brought a
tinder-box, because I thought you would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
want a fire; and I forgot to give it to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Raymond pointed to a place among
some rocks off at a little distance before him,
near the line in which he was coming along
with his fence, and advised Caleb to make a
fire there. Caleb liked this plan very much.
He said he would play &ldquo;camp out,&rdquo; and so
build a camp, and have a fire before the camp.
Raymond told him that so soon as he should
get his pile of sticks ready, he would come
and strike fire for him.</p>

<p>Caleb went to the place and began to
work. He cut down bushes, and placed them
up against the rocks, in such a manner as to
make a little hut which he should get into.
He then collected a pile of sticks in front of
it. First, he picked up all the dry sticks he
could find near, and then he sawed off branches
from the old dead trees which were lying
around in the forest.</p>

<p>In an hour, with Raymond's help in lighting
his fire, Caleb had a very good camp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
His hut was quite a comfortable one, with a
blazing fire near it, and three large apples
roasting before the fire. By and by, Caleb
saw Raymond coming towards him, with the
bag over his arm. He opened it, and took
out one parcel after another, and then laying
the mouth of the bag down upon the ground,
he took hold of the bottom of it, and raised
it in the air; while Caleb watched to see
what was coming out. It proved to be potatoes;
and Raymond told Caleb he might
roast them in his fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cover them up well with hot ashes and
coals, Caleb, and then build a fire upon the
top.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Caleb dug out the bottom of his fire
with a pole;&mdash;for the fire had pretty much
burnt down to ashes;&mdash;and he put the potatoes
in. There were five of them. Raymond
helped him to cover them up, and then he
put more sticks upon the top. When that
was done, and just as he was going back to
his work, Raymond said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
&ldquo;See there, Caleb;&mdash;there is a fine chimney
for you to burn out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb looked where Raymond pointed, and
saw a very tall and large hollow tree, or rather
trunk of a tree,&mdash;for the top had long
since decayed and dropped away. There it
stood, desolate, with a great hole in the side
near the bottom, and the bark hanging loosely
about it all the way up to the top. The
boys always liked to find such hollow trees
in the woods, to build fires in; they called
it &ldquo;burning out a chimney.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Raymond, &ldquo;all you have got
to do is to go to work while your potatoes
are roasting, and fill up that old hollow tree
at the bottom with sticks and brush, and old
pieces of bark. Pack them in close; then,
when I come to dinner, I will help you to
light it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raymond then went back to the fence,
and Caleb began his work as Raymond had
directed. He got all the dried branches
that he could find, and carried them to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
foot of the tree. Others he sawed; and he
packed all the pieces in the hollow of the
tree as closely as he could.</p>

<p>By this time Caleb saw Raymond coming
along towards the camp, and he went there
to meet him. They raked open the fire,
and took out the potatoes. Raymond turned
a stone upon its edge, towards the fire, so
as to keep them warm. He also cut some
square pieces of birch bark from a neighbouring
tree, for plates, and gave one to
Caleb, and took one himself, and then they
both sat down upon a smooth log which
Raymond drew up to the fire, and took their
birch bark plates in their lap.</p>

<p>Raymond took a little paper of salt out
of his pocket, and poured the salt out upon
another square piece of birch bark, which
he placed upon a stone between himself and
Caleb, so that both could reach it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do for a spoon?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you don't need a spoon,&rdquo; said Ray<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>mond;
and he took up a potatoe himself,
broke it in two, sprinkled some salt upon
it, and began to eat it as a boy would eat
an apple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I can't eat my potatoes so,&rdquo; said
Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not,&rdquo; said Raymond, putting a
little more salt upon his own potatoe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too hot,&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you must wait until it cools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I want a spoon very much,&rdquo; said
Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Raymond, &ldquo;I will make
you one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Raymond took out his knife and cut
off a piece from a dry pine branch, which
lay near him. He split this so as to get a
flat piece out of it, which he fashioned
into a rude sort of spoon, that answered
Caleb's purpose very well. But before Caleb
had much more than begun his dinner,
Raymond had finished his, and, rising, said
that he must go back to his work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But, first, I will set your chimney a-fire,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;I want you to let
me kindle it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can,&rdquo; said Caleb; &ldquo;I can get
some birch bark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well; only if I go away to my
work now, you must not come and trouble
me to come back again, because you can't
get the fire a-going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;I won't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Raymond went back to his work, and
Caleb finished his dinner.</p>

<p>At length, however, his potatoes and bread
and butter were all gone, and his apple
cores he had pretty thoroughly scraped with
his wooden spoon, and thrown into the fire.
So he got up from his seat, and prepared to
light his chimney. He took his plate for a
slow match. It was pretty large and stiff,
and he thought it would burn long enough
for him to carry it from the fire to his chim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>ney.
He accordingly took hold of it by
one corner, and held the other corner into
the flame, which was curling up from a
brand by the side of his fire.</p>

<p>But before the birch bark took fire, the
flame of the brand went out, and then Caleb
looked around for another. The fire had,
however, burnt nearly down, so as to leave
a great bed of embers, with the brands all
around it, the burnt ends pointing inwards,
Caleb pushed some of these into the fire,
and soon made a blaze again, and then once
more attempted to set the corner of his plate
on fire.</p>

<p>He succeeded. The corner began to
blaze and curl, and Caleb rose and moved
along carefully, lest the wind should blow
it out. This precaution was, however,
scarcely necessary, for the little wind that
his motion occasioned, only fanned the flame
the more, and the part which was on fire curled
round upon that which was not, and thus
formed a round and solid mass, which burned
fiercely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Caleb walked along, the bark blazing
higher and higher, and curling in upon itself
more and more, until, at length, he began
to be afraid it would reach his fingers before
he could get to his chimney. He walked
faster and faster, and presently began to
run. This fanned the fire the more, until,
just as he came within a few steps of his
chimney, the curling bark reached his
fingers, and he tripped over a great root at
the very instant when he was dropping the
piece of bark from his hands. He came
down upon all-fours, and the bark which
was now a compact roll, rolled down a little
slope, crackling and blazing by the way.</p>

<p>Caleb got up and looked at the blazing
mass a minute or two, in despair; but finding
that it kept on burning, his eye suddenly
brightened, and he said aloud,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll poke it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he looked around for a stick. He
readily found one, and began to push the
blazing roll up the acclivity; but as fast as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
he pushed it up, it rolled down again, and
all his efforts were consequently vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O dear me!&rdquo; said Caleb, at length throwing
down his stick, &ldquo;what <i>shall</i> I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meantime the roll continued
blazing, and Caleb, looking at it steadily,
observed that it was hollow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I'll <i>stick</i> him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he took up his stick again, and tried
to thrust the end of the stick <i>into</i> the roll.
After one or two ineffectual attempts, he
succeeded, though by this time the bark
was pretty well burnt through, and was all
ready to fall to pieces. He, however, succeeded
in raising it into the air, upon the
end of his pole; but before he got it to the
hollow tree, it dropped off again in several
blazing fragments, which continued to burn
a moment upon the ground, and then went
out entirely.</p>

<p>Caleb then went to Raymond, and told
him that he could not make his fire burn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O you must not come to me, youngster;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
you promised not to trouble me with it,&rdquo;
said Raymond, as he hooked the chain around
the butt-end of another tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought I could make it burn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what's the matter with it? But
stand back, for I am going to start this tree
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why the bark all curls up and burns my
hand,&rdquo; said Caleb, retreating at the same
time out of the way of the top of Raymond's
tree.</p>

<p>The oxen started along, dragging the
tree, and Caleb followed, trying to get an
opportunity to speak once more to Raymond.
Raymond, however, went calling
aloud to his oxen, and directing them here
and there with his &ldquo;Gee, Star,&rdquo; and his
&ldquo;Ha, Lion,&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Wo up, Whoa&rdquo;.</p>

<p>At length, however, he had the tree in its
place, and seeing Caleb standing at a little
distance patiently, he asked him again,</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say is the matter with your
fire, Caleb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the birch bark curls up and burns
me: I wish you would come and set it
a-fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Raymond, walking along by
the side of his oxen; &ldquo;I must not leave
my work to help you play; but I will tell
you three ways to carry the fire, and you
can manage it in one or the other of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he took out his knife, and cut
down a small, slender maple, which was
growing near him, and trimmed off the top
and the few little branches which were growing
near the top. It made a slender pole
about five feet long, with smooth but freckled
bark, from end to end. He then made
a little split in one end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, Caleb,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;take that, and
stick a piece of birch bark in the split end;
then you can carry it, and let it curl as
much as it pleases. Or, if that fails, put a
large piece of birch bark directly upon the
fire. Then, as soon as it begins to burn, it
will begin to curl, and then you must put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the end of the stick down to it, in such a
manner that the bark will curl over and
grasp it, and then you can take it up and
carry the roll upon the end of your pole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;there are two
ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are two ways,&rdquo; repeated Raymond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, if both these fail, you must put on
a good many fresh sticks upon the fire, with
one end of each of them out. Then, as soon
as the ends which are in the fire have got
burnt through, take up two of them by the
ends that were out of the fire and lay them
down at the foot of the hollow tree, close to
the wood you have got together there. Then
come back and get two more brands, and
lay them down in the same way, and be
careful to have the burnt ends all together.
So you must keep going back and forth,
until you find that the brands are beginning
to burn up freely in the new place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb took the maple pole and went back
to his fire. He tore the salt-cellar in two,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
and this made two very good small strips of
bark. He pulled open the split end of his
pole, and carefully inserted one of them, and
then, holding it over a little flame which was
rising from a burning brand, he set it on
fire. The bark was soon in a blaze, and it
writhed and curled as if it were struggling
to get away; but it only clung to the end of
the pole more closely; and Caleb, much
pleased at the success of his experiment, waved
it in the air, and shouted to Raymond
to look and see.</p>

<p>He then walked slowly along, stopping
every moment to wave his great flambeau,
and shout; and so, when at last he reached
the hollow tree, the bark was nearly burnt
out, and the fragments were beginning to fall
off from the end of the pole. He then thrust
it hastily under the heap of fuel, which had
been collected in the tree; but it was too
late. It flickered and smoked a minute or
two, and finally went out altogether.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care,&rdquo; said Caleb to himself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
&ldquo;for I have got the other half of the salt-cellar;&rdquo;
and he went back for that. It happened
unluckily, however, this time, that,
in pulling open the cleft which Raymond had
made in his maple pole, he pulled too hard,
and split one side off. Here was at once
an end to all attempts to communicate fire
to his chimney by this method. So, after
refitting the split part of his stick to its
place, once or twice, and finding that the
idea of uniting it again was entirely out of
the question, he threw the broken piece away,
and said to himself that he must try Raymond's
second plan.</p>

<p>He accordingly took the other large piece
of bark, which was the one which Raymond
had used for his plate, and laid it upon the
fire. As soon as it began to curl, he laid
the end of the stick close to it, on the side
towards which it seemed to be bending,&mdash;and
in such a way that it curled over upon
it, and soon clasped it tight, as Raymond
had predicted that it would do. He then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
raised it in the air, and set out to run with
it, so that it should not burn out before he
reached the place. But he ought not to
have run. It would have been far safer and
better to have walked along carefully and
slowly; for as he ran on, jumping over logs
and stones, and scrambling up and down
the hummocks, the top of the pole, with the
blazing roll of bark, was jerked violently
about in the air, until, at length, as he was
wheeling around a tree, he accidentally
held the top of the pole so far that it wheeled
round through the air very swiftly, and
threw the birch bark off by the centrifugal
force: and away it went, rolling along upon
the ground.</p>

<p>The centrifugal force is that which makes
any thing fly off when it is whirled round
and round.</p>

<p>Caleb did not understand this very well,
but he was surprised to see his roll flying
off in that manner. He immediately took
two sticks, and tried to take up the roll with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
them, as one would with a pair of tongs;
but he could not hold it with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I must try the
third way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he began to gather sticks, and put the
ends of them upon the fire. When they
began to burn, he took up one; but as soon
as he got it off the fire, it began to go out,
and he said that he knew that way to kindle
a fire never would do. In fact, he began to
get out of patience. He threw down the
stick, and went off again after Raymond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raymond,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I <i>cannot</i> make my
fire burn; and I wish you would come and
kindle it for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you tried the ways I told you
about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you tried all of them faithfully?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All but the last,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;and I
know that won't do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must try them all, faithfully, or
else I can't come.&rdquo; So saying, Raymond
went on with his work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Caleb went back a good deal out of humour
with himself, and saying that he wished
Raymond was not so cross. He took up
two of the sticks, which were now pretty
well on fire, and carried them along, swinging
them by the way, to make fiery rings
and serpents in the air. When he reached
the chimney, he threw them down carelessly,
and stood watching them, to see if they
were going to burn. Instead, however, of
setting the other wood on fire, they only
grew dimmer and dimmer themselves; and
he said to himself, &ldquo;I knew they would not
burn.&rdquo; Then he sat down upon a log, in
a sad state of fretfulness and dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>However, after waiting a few minutes,
longer, he went back to the fire, determined
to bring all the brands there were, and put
them down, though he knew, he said, that
they would not burn. He was going to do
it, so that then he could go and tell Raymond
that he had tried all his plans, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
that now he must come, and light the fire
himself.</p>

<p>So he walked along, back and forth bringing
the brands, and laying them down together
near the foot of the heap of fuel in
the tree. But before he had brought them
all, he found that they began to brighten up
a little, and at length they broke out into a
little flame. He stood and watched it a
few minutes. It blazed up higher and
higher. He then put on some more wood
which was near. The flame crept up between
these sticks, and soon began to snap
and crackle among the brush in the tree.
Caleb stepped back, and watched the flame
a moment as it flashed up higher and higher,
and then clapped his hands, jumped up
on a log, and shouted out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raymond, it's a-burning, its a-burning.&rdquo;</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE CAPTIVE.</h3>

<p>When Raymond heard Caleb's voice calling
to him so loudly, he paused a moment
from his work, and seeing that the fire had
actually taken, in earnest, he told Caleb that
he must go back a little way, for by-and-bye
the tree would fall. So Caleb went
back to some distance, and asked Raymond
if that was far enough. Raymond said it
was, and Raymond then sat down upon a
log, with his maple pole in his hand, to
watch the progress of the fire.</p>

<p>A dense smoke soon began to pour out
of the top of the chimney. The fire roared
up through the hollow, and it caught outside
too, under the bark, and soon enveloped
the whole tree in smoke, sparks, and flame.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Large pieces of the blazing bark detached
themselves, from time to time, from the
side of the tree, and came down, crackling
and sparkling to the ground; and the opening
below where Caleb had crammed in his
fuel, soon glowed like the mouth of a furnace.</p>

<p>Near the top of the tree was an old
branch, or rather the stump of an old branch,
decayed and blackened, reaching out a little
way, like an arm. This was soon enveloped
in smoke; and, as Caleb was watching
it, as it appeared and disappeared in the
wreaths, he thought he saw something move.
He looked again, intently. It was a squirrel,&mdash;half
suffocated in the smoke, and
struggling to hold on. Caleb immediately
called out to Raymond as loud as he could
call,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raymond, Raymond, come here, quick:
here is a poor squirrel burning up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raymond dropped his axe, and ran,&mdash;bounding
over the logs, and hummocks;
but before he reached the place, the squir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>rel,
unable to hold on any longer, and half
stifled with the smoke and scorching heat,
dropped from his hold to the ground. Raymond
came up at the moment, and seized
him; he brought him to where Caleb was
sitting,&mdash;Caleb himself eagerly coming forward
to see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it dead?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty much,&rdquo; said Raymond. The
squirrel lay gasping helplessly in Raymond's
hands. &ldquo;Here, put him in my cap,&rdquo; said
Caleb; &ldquo;that will make a good bed for
him, and perhaps he will come to life again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raymond examined him pretty carefully,
and he did not seem to be burnt. He said
he thought he must have been suffocated by
breathing the smoke and hot air. Raymond
then went back to his work, and Caleb sat
upon the log, watching alternately the squirrel
and the burning tree.</p>

<p>In a few minutes a great flame flashed out
at the top of the tree: and finally, after
about half an hour, the whole trunk, being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
all in a blaze, from top to bottom, began
slowly to bend and bend over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raymond,&rdquo; shouted Caleb,&mdash;&ldquo;Raymond,
look;&mdash;it is going to fall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tall trunk moved at first slowly, but
soon more and more rapidly, and finally
came down to the ground with a crash.</p>

<p>The crash startled the little squirrel, so
that he almost regained his feet; and Caleb
was afraid that he was going to run away.
But he laid over again upon his side, and
was soon quiet again as before.</p>

<p>Not long after this, Raymond finished his
work, and prepared to go home. He proposed
to Caleb that they should leave the
squirrel there, upon the log; but Caleb was
very desirous to carry him home, because,
he said, he could tame him, and give him
to Mary Anna. So Raymond asked how
they should contrive to carry him. Caleb
wanted to carry him home in his cap; but
Raymond said that he would take cold by
riding home bare-headed. &ldquo;However<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>,&rdquo;
said Raymond, &ldquo;Perhaps I can contrive
something.&rdquo; So he went after another piece
of birch bark from the tree, about six inches
wide, and two feet long, and rolled it over,
bringing the two ends together, so as to
make a sort of round box,&mdash;only it was without
top or bottom. To keep it in shape he
tied a string round it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how are you going to keep him in?&rdquo;
asked Caleb.</p>

<p>Raymond said nothing, but he took a
handkerchief out of his jacket pocket, and
spread it out upon the ground, and put his
birch bark box upon it. He then laid the
squirrel gently in upon the handkerchief,
which thus served for a bottom. Next he
drew the corners of the handkerchief up
over the top, and tied the opposite pairs of
ends together. Thus the handkerchief served
for top, bottom, and handle.</p>

<p>They soon reached the place where they
had left the cart; they got into it and rode
on. Caleb held the squirrel in his lap, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of course, as there was nothing but the thin
handkerchief for a bottom to the box, Caleb
felt the weight of the squirrel, pressing soft
and warm upon his knees. The squirrel
lay very still until they got very near home,
and then Caleb began to feel a creeping
sensation, as if he was beginning to move.
Caleb was highly delighted to perceive these
signs of returning life; he held his knees
perfectly still, that he might not disturb
him, crying out, however, to Raymond,</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's moving, Raymond; he's moving,
he's moving.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>
<h3>MARY ANNA.</h3>

<p>Caleb and Raymond reached home about
the middle of the afternoon: and while Raymond
went into the yard to leave the cart
and turn out the cattle, Caleb pressed eagerly
into the house, to shew his prize. Mary
Anna, or Marianne, as they generally called
her, came to meet him to see what he had
got in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that my birch bark?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! I forgot your birch bark,&rdquo; said
Caleb.&mdash;&ldquo;But I have got something here a
great deal better.&rdquo; And so saying he put
his handkerchief down, and began very eagerly
to untie the knots.</p>

<p>When he had got two of the ends untied,
and was at work upon the other two, out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
leaped the squirrel, and ran across the room.
Mary Anna, startled by the sudden appearance
of the animal, ran off to the door, and
Caleb called out in great distress, &ldquo;O dear!
O dear! What shall I do? He'll get away.
Shut the door, Mary Anna,&mdash;shut the door,
quick! call Raymond; call Raymond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Anna, at first, retreated outside of
the door, and stood there a moment, peeping
in. Finding, however, that the squirrel
remained very quiet in a corner of the room,
she returned softly, and went round, and shut
all the doors and windows, and then Caleb
went and called Raymond.</p>

<p>The squirrel had by no means yet got over
his accident, and he allowed himself to be
easily retaken and secured. Raymond contrived
to fasten him into a box, so as to keep
him safe, until next morning; and by that
time they thought, if he should then seem
likely to get well, they could determine what
it was best to do with him.</p>

<p>While Caleb was coming home, there had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
been a strange mixture of delight and uneasiness
in his feelings. The delight was
occasioned by the possession of the squirrel.
That was obvious enough. The uneasiness
he did not think about very distinctly,
and did not notice what the cause of it
was. Boys very often feel a sort of uneasiness
of mind,&mdash;they do not know exactly
how or why,&mdash;and they have this feeling
mingling sometimes strangely with their
very enjoyment, in their hours of gaiety
and glee. Now the real reason of this unquiet
state of mind, in Caleb's case, was
that his conscience had been disturbed by
his feelings of vexation and impatience, towards
Raymond, for not leaving his work,
to come and kindle his fire. He had not
<i>yielded</i> to these feelings. He had restrained
them, and had stood still, and spoken
respectfully to Raymond, all the time. In
fact, he was hardly aware that he had done
any thing wrong, at all. But still, for a
moment, selfish passions had had possession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
of his heart, and whenever they get possession,
even if they are kept in subjection, so
as not to lead to any bad actions or words,
and even if they are soon driven away by
new thoughts, as Caleb's were, by the sight
of his blazing fire,&mdash;still, they always leave
more or less of misery behind.</p>

<p>So Caleb, as he was going home, had his
heart filled with delight at the thoughts of
the squirrel resting warmly in his lap; and
he was also a prey, in some degree, to a
gnawing uneasiness, which he could not
understand, but which was really caused by
a sting which sin had left there.</p>

<p>And yet Caleb came home with an idea
that he had been a very good boy. So, after
they had got tired of looking at the squirrel,
and Mary Anna had taken her seat at
her work by the window, with her little work-table
before her, Caleb came up to her, and
kneeling upon her cricket, and putting his
arms in her lap, he said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Aunt Marianne, I have been a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
good boy all day to-day, and so I want you
to make me a picture-book, this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marianne had a way of making picture-books
that pleased children very much.
The way was this: she used to save all the
old, worn-out picture books, and loose pictures,
she could find, and put them carefully
in one of her drawers, up stairs. Then she
would make a small blank book, of white paper,
and sew it through the back. Then
she would cut out pictures enough from her
old stores to fill the book, leaving the colours
blank, because they were to be covered
with some pretty-coloured paper, for a
title. Then she would paste the pictures
in. And here, when Mary Anna first began
to make such books, an unexpected difficulty
arose. For, when paper is wet, it
swells; and then, when it dries again, though
it shrinks a little, and does not shrink back
quite into its original dimensions,&mdash;that is,
quite to the length and breadth that it had
at first. Now, when Mary Anna pasted her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
pictures in the pages of the book, that part
of the leaf which was under the picture was
wet by the paste, and so it swelled, while
the other part remained dry. And when
the picture came to dry, it did not shrink
quite back again. It remained swelled a
little; and this caused the page to look
warped or puckered, so that the leaves did
not lie smooth together.</p>

<p>At length she found out a way to remedy
this difficulty entirely; and this was, to wet
the whole of the leaf, as well as that part
that the picture was pasted to, and that made
it all swell alike. The way she managed
the operation was this:</p>

<p>After sewing the book, she would cut out
a piece of morocco paper, or blue paper, or
gilt paper, and sometimes a piece of morocco
itself, just the size of the book when
open, for the cover. Then, after spreading
out a large newspaper upon the table, so as
to keep the table clean, she would lay down
the cover with the handsome side down, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
then spread the paste over the other side,
very carefully, with a brush which she made
from the end of a quill. Then she would
put the back edge of the book down upon
this cover, and lay it over, first on one side,
and then on the other, and pat it down well
with a towel; and that would make the cover
stick to the outside leaves of the book, and
cover up and hide the great stitches in the
back, by which the leaves had been sewed
together. Then she would take the book
before her, and begin at the beginning.
First, she would lay down the cover and put
upon it a piece of tin, made to fill papers
with, to keep it down smooth. Then she
would lay the next leaf down upon the tin.
The leaf was to have the title-page upon it,
and so there were to be no pictures pasted
to it. She would, therefore, lay this down
upon the tin, and then, with one of her large
paint brushes, dipped in the water, she
would wet it all over, patting it afterwards
with a towel, to take up all the superfluous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
water. Then she would take up the tin,
and put the title-leaf down upon the cover,
and put the tin over it to keep it down
smooth. The next leaf would be for pictures,
and, after pasting pictures upon it, on
both sides, she would lay it down upon the
tin, and with her brush she would wet all
those parts which had not been pasted.
Then patting it with a dry towel, or soft
cloth, to dry it as much as possible, she
would put it under the tin. In this way
she would go on regularly, through the book,
pasting pictures upon all the pages, and
wetting with her brush all those parts of the
paper which had not been wet by the paste,
and putting the tin over the leaves as fast
as she finished them, to keep them all smooth.
Then, when she had got through, she
would put the whole away between two
boards, to dry; the weight of the paper board
being sufficient to keep the leaves all smooth.
The next morning when she came to look
at her book, she generally found it nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
dry; and then she would put some heavy
weight upon the upper board, to press it
harder. When it was perfectly dry, she
took out the book, and pared off the edges,
all around, with a sharp knife and a rule.
Then she would get her paint-box, and colour
all the pictures beautifully, and make
borders about them, in bright colours, and
print a handsome title-page with her pen,
and write the name of the boy in it whom
she meant to give it to.</p>

<p>So Caleb, when he came and told Mary
Anna, what a good boy he had been, meant
to have her make such a book as this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But sometimes boys are mistaken in
thinking they have been good boys. I should
want to ask Raymond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would say so, I know,&rdquo; said Caleb;
&ldquo;for I certainly did not trouble him at all,
all the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you run and ask him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Caleb; and away he ran.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But stop,&rdquo; said Mary Anna; &ldquo;you must
not ask him by a leading question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you know?&rdquo; said Mary Anna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, that is very important for boys to
know; for they very often ask leading questions,
when they ought not to. Now, if you
go and say, 'Raymond, haven't I been a
good boy to-day?' that way of asking the
question shews that you want him to say,
'Yes, you have.' It is called a leading question,
because it leads Raymond to answer in
a particular way. Now, if I should go and
ask him thus, '<i>Has</i> Caleb been a good boy
to-day?' with the emphasis on <i>has</i>, it would
be a leading question the other way. It
would sound as if I wanted him to say you
had not been a good boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How must I ask him, then?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why you can say, 'Raymond, Aunt
Marianne wants to know what sort of a boy
I have been to-day,' that way of putting the
question would not lead him one way or
the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he might know,&rdquo; said Caleb,
&ldquo;that I should want him to say I have been
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not from the form of the question.
The <i>question</i> would not lead him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Mary Anna was saying this, Caleb
was standing with his hand upon the latch
of the door, ready to go; and when she had
finished what she was saying, he started off
to find Raymond.</p>

<p>As he passed across the yard, he heard
the sound of voices before the house. It was
Dwight and David coming home from school.
In a minute they appeared in view, by the
great elm. Dwight had a long slender pole
in his hands, which he was waving in the air,
and David had a small piece of wood, and a
knife. He sat down under the elm, and began
to shave the wood with the knife.</p>

<p>Caleb ran to tell them about his squirrel;
but before he got there, Dwight, seeing him,
began to wave his pole in the air, and shout,
and then said, &ldquo;See what a noble flag-staff
we have got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that your flag-staff?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. John Davis gave it to us. He
got it out of his father's shop. We are going
to set it up out at the end of our mole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said David, &ldquo;and I am going to
make a truck on the top, to haul up the flag
by. Marianne is going to make us a flag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A truck?&rdquo; said Caleb, enquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said David, &ldquo;a little wheel to put
a string over to hoist it by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb looked upon the pole, and upon
David's work, for a minute in silence, and
then said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have got something better than a flag-staff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A squirrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A squirrel!&rdquo; said David in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;a grey squirrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; said David, looking up
eagerly, from his work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the back-room,&rdquo; said Caleb. &ldquo;Raymond
put him in a box.&mdash;Come, and I will
shew him to you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down went Dwight's pole, in a moment;
David, too, shut his knife, and put it in
his pocket, and off they went to see the
squirrel.</p>

<p>The little nut-cracker was frightened at
seeing so many eyes peeping in upon him
from every crevice and opening in his box.
He looked much brighter and better than
he did when he was put into the box, and
Caleb thought he would get entirely well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I wish I had him,&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to keep him in a cage,&rdquo; said
Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish he was mine,&rdquo; said Dwight.
&ldquo;Why can't you give him to me, Caleb?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, no,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;I want to keep
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't know how to take care of
him,&rdquo; said Dwight. &ldquo;Come, you give him
to me, and I will give you my flag-staff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;I don't want any
flag-staff. I want to keep the squirrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, see,&rdquo; said David, &ldquo;he is creeping
along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said Dwight, &ldquo;I <i>wish</i> he was
mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, he is curling up in the corner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you give him to me for my top?&rdquo;
said Dwight, very eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's going to eat that kernel of corn,&rdquo;
said David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you might give him to
me,&rdquo; said Dwight, pettishly, &ldquo;for that
top; the top is worth a great deal the
most.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a few minutes, Dwight finding that
there was no prospect of inducing Caleb
to sell him the squirrel, desisted from his
attempts; and then, after a moment's pause,
he said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think it is your squirrel, after
all, Caleb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose is it then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raymond's. He saved it. The poor
thing would have been burnt up, if he had
not run and caught it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he wouldn't,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;I was
just going to get him myself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dwight, having decided in his own mind
that the squirrel was Raymond's, ran off to
find Raymond, with the design of asking
him to give the squirrel to him. But Raymond
said the squirrel was Caleb's.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you caught him,&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I caught him for Caleb, not
for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you fixed the box to bring him
home in,&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, but I only did it to please
Caleb. The squirrel is his altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Dwight had to return disappointed.</p>

<p>When Caleb came in, Mary Anna was
putting up her work, and arranging her
things neatly in her drawer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Caleb,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and what did
Raymond say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, he said it was mine,&rdquo; replied
Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was yours?&rdquo; said Mary Anna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The squirrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The squirrel!&rdquo; repeated Mary Anna;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
&ldquo;you went to ask him what sort of a boy
you had been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O!&rdquo; said Caleb&mdash;&ldquo;there!&mdash;I forgot
all about that. I'll run and ask him now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;stop,&rdquo; said Mary Anna; &ldquo;it is
time for supper now; and besides, I will
take your word for it; you are a pretty honest
boy. You say you was a pleasant boy
all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;I was.&rdquo; He had
forgotten his <i>feelings</i> of ill-humour, when
Raymond would not come and light his
fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you think I ought to make you a
picture book for a reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;I wish you would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I cannot tell how pleasant in mind
you have been all day, unless I know what
you have had to try you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To try me?&rdquo; asked Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I want to know what troubles, or
difficulties, or disappointments you had to
bear, and did bear patiently and pleasantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb looked a little perplexed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, Caleb,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;there is no merit in being pleasant unless
things go wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn't there?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said Mary Anna, as she
shut up her work-table drawer, &ldquo;is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why no,&rdquo; said Caleb, smiling; for he
could not help smiling, while yet he was a
little disappointed at finding all his fancied
goodness melted away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, did you have a good time in the
woods to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Raymond take good care of you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did you have a good dinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and a noble great fire,&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You little rogue, then!&rdquo; said Mary
Anna, laughing, and stabbing at his sides
with her finger; &ldquo;here you have been having
a beautiful time in the woods, amusing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
yourself all day, and had every thing to
please you; and now you come to me to
pay you for not having been impatient and
fretful! You little rogue!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb turned, and ran laughing away,
Mary Anna after him, and pointing at him
with her finger. Caleb made his escape
into the front entry, and hid behind the door.
Mary Anna pretended to have lost sight of
him, and not to know where he was; and
she went about, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is that little rogue? He came
to get away one of my picture-books for
nothing. He wanted to be paid for bearing
happiness patiently. The rogue! I'll pinch
him if I can only find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, Mary Anna went and sat down
to supper, and soon after Caleb came and
took his seat too; Mary Anna roguishly
shaking her finger at him all the time. He
had to hold his hand over his mouth to keep
from laughing aloud.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of the readers of this book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
may smile at Caleb's idea of his merit in
having been a pleasant boy all day, when
he felt vexed and unsubmissive in the only
case which brought him any trial; but it is
so with almost all children, and some grown
persons too. A great deal of the goodness
upon which we all pride ourselves, is only
the quiescence of bad propensities in the absence
of temptation and trial.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE WALK.</h3>

<p>Outside of the window in Madam Rachel's
bedroom, where the children used to sit
and talk with her just before going to bed,
there was a little platform, with a plain roof
over it, supported by small square posts, altogether
forming a sort of portico. Below
this window there were two doors, opening
from the middle out each way, so that when
the window was raised, and the doors were
opened, a person could walk in and out.
There were seats in the portico, and there
was a wild grape-vine growing upon a plain
trellis, on each side. In front of the portico
was one of the broad walks of the garden,
for on this side the garden extended up to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
house. At least there was no fence between,
though there was a small plot of green grass
next to the house; and next to that came
the trees and flowers.</p>

<p>One pleasant evening Dwight and Caleb
were playing on this grass, waiting for Madam
Rachel to come and call them in to the
sofa. It was about eight o'clock, but it
was not dark. The western sky still looked
bright; for though the sun had gone down,
so that it could no longer shine upon the
trees and houses, it still shone upon the
clouds and atmosphere above, and made
them look bright.</p>

<p>Presently Madam Rachel came, and
stood at the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where's David?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out in the garden,&rdquo; said Dwight,
&ldquo;and mother,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I wish you
would walk in the garden to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first, Madam Rachel said she thought
she could not very well that evening, for
she had a difficult text to talk about; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the boys promised to walk along quietly,
and to be very sober and attentive; and so
she went and put on her garden bonnet, and
came out.</p>

<p>The garden was not large, it extended
back to some high rocky precipices, where
the boys used sometimes to climb up for
play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said Madam Rachel, as
she sauntered along the walk, the children
around her, &ldquo;that you will not like the verse
that I am going to talk with you about this
evening, very well, when you first hear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it mother?&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'And you hath he quickened, who were
dead in trespasses and sins.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does <i>quickened</i> mean?&rdquo; asked
David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Made alive, or brought to life. <i>Quick</i>
means <i>alive</i>, sometimes; as for instance, the
quick and the dead, means the living and
the dead. And so we say, 'cut to the quick,'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
that is, cut to the living flesh, where it can
feel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once I read in a fable,&rdquo; said David,
&ldquo;of a horse being stung to the quick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, by a hornet?&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said David, &ldquo;by something the
ass said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, yes,&rdquo; said Madam Rachel, &ldquo;that
means it hurt his feelings. If a bee should
sting any body so that the sting should only
go into the skin, it would not hurt much;
but if it should go in deep, so as to give
great pain, we should say it stung to the
quick, that is, to the part which has life and
feeling. So I suppose that something that
the ass said, hurt the horse's feelings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it, David, that the ass said?&rdquo;
asked Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;he said, I believe that the horse
was proud, or something like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter about that fable now,&rdquo; said
their mother; &ldquo;you understand the meaning
of the verse. It was written to good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
men; it says that God gave them life and
feeling, when they <i>were</i> dead in trespasses
and sins. But I must first tell you what
<i>dead</i> means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, we know what '<i>dead</i>' means, well
enough,&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not exactly what it means here,&rdquo;
said Madam Rachel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Dead</i> means here <i>insensible</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don't know what <i>insensible</i> means,&rdquo;
said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will explain it to you,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;Once there were two boys who quarreled
in the recess at school; and the teacher decided
that for their punishment they should
be publicly reproved before all the scholars.
So, after school, they were required to stand
up in their places, and listen to the reprimand.
While they were standing, and the
teacher was telling them that they had done
very wrong,&mdash;had indulged bad passions,
and displeased God, and destroyed their
own happiness, and brought disgrace upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the school,&mdash;one of them stood up with a
bold and careless air, while the teacher
was speaking, and afterwards when he took
his seat, looked round to the other scholars,
and laughed. The other boy hung
his head, and looked very much ashamed;
and as the teacher had finished what he
was saying, he sunk into his seat, put his
head down upon his desk before him, and
burst into tears. Now, the first one was
<i>insensible</i>, or as it is called in this text, <i>dead</i>
to all sense of shame. The other was <i>alive</i>
to it. You understand now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother,&rdquo; said the boys.</p>

<p>The party walked on for a short time in
silence, admiring the splendid and beautiful
scenery which was presented to view, in
the setting sun, and the calm tranquility
which reigned around.</p>

<p>Suddenly Caleb, seeing a beautiful lily
growing in a border, as they were walking by,
stopped to gather it. Madam Rachel was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
afraid that he was not attending to what she
was saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Caleb,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that's a very
pretty lily; but suppose you should go and
hold it before Seizem. Do you suppose
he would care any thing about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seizem was a great dog that belonged to
Madam Rachel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, grandmother,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;I don't
think he would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And suppose you were to go and pat him
on his head, and tell him he was a good
dog, would he care any thing about that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dwight; &ldquo;he would jump,
and wag his tail, and almost laugh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you see, boys, that Seizem is
'quick' and alive to praise; but to beauty
of colour, and form he is insensible, and
as it were, dead. The beauty makes no
impression upon him at all, he is stupid and
lifeless, so far as that is concerned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, what is meant by men being dead
in trespasses and sins is, that they are thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
insensible to God's goodness, and their duty
to love and obey him. Suppose, now, I
was to go out into the street, and find
some boys talking harshly and roughly
to one another, as boys often do in their
plays; and suppose they were boys that I
knew, so that it was proper for me to give
them advice; now, if I were to go and tell
them that it was the law of God that they
should be kind to one another, and that they
ought to be so, and thus obey and please
him, what effect do you think it would
have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They would not mind it very much,&rdquo;
said David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> expect that they would though,&rdquo; said
Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think that they would mind it
much myself. Each one wants to have his
own way, and to seek his own pleasures,
and they do not see the excellence of obeying
and pleasing God at all. It seems to
me a very excellent thing for boys to try to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
please God, but I know very well that most
boys care no more about it than Seizem
would for your lily, Caleb. In respect to
God they are insensible and dead; dead in
trespasses and sins, and the only hope for
them is, that God will <i>quicken</i> them; that
is, give them <i>life</i> and <i>feeling</i>; and then, if I
say just the same things to them, they will
listen seriously and attentively, and will
really desire to please God. As it is now
with almost all boys, they are so insensible
and dead to all sense of regard to God, that
when we want to influence them to do their
duty, we must appeal to some other motive;
something that they have more sensibility to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For example, you remember the other
day when you went a strawberrying with
Mary Anna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I recollect that I thought there
was great danger that you might be troublesome
to Mary Anna, or to some others of
the party; and I wanted to say something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
to you before you went, to make you a good
boy. The highest and best motive would
have been for me to say, 'Now, Dwight,
remember and do what is <i>right</i> to-day.
The trees and fields, and pleasant sunshine;
the flowers and the strawberries, your own
health and strength, and joyous feelings, all
come from God; the whole scene that you
are going to enjoy to-day, he has contrived
for you, and now he will watch over you
all the time, and be pleased if he sees you
careful and conscientious in doing right all
day. Now, be a good boy, for the sake of
pleasing him.' Suppose I had said that to
you, do you think it would have made you a
good boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dwight held down his head, and said,
hesitatingly, that he did not think it would.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That motive would have been piety. If
a boy takes pains to do what is right, and
avoid what is wrong, because he is grateful
to God, and wishes to please him, it is piety.
But I was afraid that would not have much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
influence with you, and so I tried to think
of some other motive. I thought of filial
affection next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Filial affection is a boy's love for his
father or mother,&rdquo; replied Madam Rachel.
&ldquo;I said to myself, How will it do to appeal
to Dwight's filial affection, to-day? I can
say to him, 'Now, Dwight, be a good boy
to-day, to please me. I shall be very happy
to-night if Mary Anna comes home and
says that you have been kind, and gentle
and yielding all day.' But then, on reflection,
I thought that <i>that</i> motive would not
be powerful enough. I knew you had at
least some desire to please me, but I had
some doubt whether it would be enough to
carry you through all the temptations of the
whole day. Do you recollect what I did say
to you, Dwight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother,&rdquo; replied Dwight, &ldquo;you
told me just before I went away, that if I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
was a good, pleasant boy, Mary Anna would
want to take me again some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and what principle in your heart
was that appealing to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dwight did not answer. David said,
&ldquo;Selfishness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said his mother; &ldquo;or rather not
selfishness, but self-love. Selfishness means
not only a desire for our own happiness, but
injustice towards others. It would have
been wrong for me to have appealed to
Dwight's selfishness, as that would have
been encouraging a bad passion; but it was
right for me to appeal to his self-love, that
is, to shew him how his own future enjoyment
would depend upon his being a good
boy that day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Dwight, do you think that what I
said had any influence over you that
day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother,&rdquo; said Dwight, &ldquo;I think
it did. I thought of it a good many times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would it have had as much influence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
if I had asked you to be a good boy only to
please me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dwight acknowledged that he did not
think it would.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think it would have had as much
influence if I had asked you to do right to
please God?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mother,&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think that would have had any
influence at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dwight seemed at a loss, and said he didn't
know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do <i>you</i> think it would?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Madam Rachel, though
she spoke in rather a doubtful tone. &ldquo;I rather
think it would have had some influence&mdash;not
much, but <i>some</i>. He would not have
thought of it very often, but still, I rather
think, at least I hope, that Dwight has <i>some</i>
desire to please God, and that it now and
then influences him a little. But in boys
generally, I don't think that such a motive
would have any influence at all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not any at all?&rdquo; said David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you can judge for yourself. Do
you suppose that the boys at school, and
those that you meet in the street, are influenced
in their conduct every day, by any
desire to please God?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, nobody tells them,&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, yes, they have been told over and
over again, at church, and in the Sabbath
school, till they are tired of hearing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys were silent, and the whole party
walked along very slowly, for several steps;
and then David said that he thought that
though the boys were pretty bad, he did
not think they were quite so bad as they
would be, if they did not hear any thing about
God. He said it seemed to him that it had
some influence upon them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, yes,&rdquo; said Madam Rachel, &ldquo;I have
no doubt that what is said to them about
their duty to God has a very important influence
over them in various ways. Religious
instruction produces a great many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
good effects upon the conduct of boys and
men, even where it does not awaken any
genuine love for God, and honest desire to
please him. That is a peculiar feeling.
I will tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, Madam Rachel paused, and
seemed a moment to be lost in thought.
The whole party had by this time gone almost
the whole round of the walk, and were
now slowly sauntering towards the house
and as Madam Rachel said those last words,
they were just passing along by the side of
the rocky declivity at the back of the garden.
Madam Rachel looked upon the rocks, and
saw a beautiful little blue-bell growing
there in a crevice, and hanging over at
the top.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a beautiful blue-bell there is!&rdquo;
said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; said the boys, looking around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;just by the side of
the little fir-tree. How Mary Anna would
admire it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll climb up and get it for her,&rdquo; said
Dwight. &ldquo;I'll have it in a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He dropped his mother's hand, and began
scrambling up the rocks. They were
jagged and irregular fragments, with bushes
and trees among them, and Dwight, who
was a very expert climber, soon had the
blue-bell in his hand, and was coming down
delighted with his prize. He brought the
leaves of the plant with it, and it was in fact
an elegant little flower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Dwight,&rdquo; said Madam Rachel,
as they walked along again, Dwight holding
his flower very carefully in his hand, &ldquo;notice
this feeling you have towards Mary
Anna, which led you to get the flower. It
was not fear of her,&mdash;it was not hope of getting
any reward from her, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, mother,&rdquo; said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was simply a desire to give her pleasure.
When you go in, you will take a
pleasure yourself in going to her, and gratifying
her with the present. Now, do you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
suppose that the boys generally have any
such feeling as that towards God?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mother,&rdquo; said David, &ldquo;I don't think
they have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor do I. They are dead to all such
feelings. They take no pleasure in pleasing
God. They don't like to think of him,
and I don't see that they shew any signs of
having any love for him at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They walked along, after this, silently.
Dwight saw how destitute of love to God
his heart had been, and still was; and yet
he could not help thinking that he did
sometimes feel a little grateful to God for
all his kindness and care; and at least
some faint desires to please him.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when they arrived at
the house; and Dwight asked his mother
to let him run and give Mary Anna her
blue-bell. She was very much pleased with
it indeed. She arranged it and the leaves
that Dwight had brought with it, so as to
give the whole group a graceful form, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
put it in water, saying she meant to rise
early the next morning to paint it. Dwight
determined that he would get up too and
see her do it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE JUNK.</h3>

<p>A few days after this, when David and
Dwight were at work one evening upon their
mole, and Caleb was playing near, sometimes
helping a little and sometimes looking
on, Mary Anna came down to see them.
They had nearly finished the stone-work
and were trying to contrive some way to
fasten up their flag-staff at the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can't drive the flag-staff down into
our mole,&rdquo; said Dwight, looking up with an
anxious and perplexed expression to Mary
Anna, &ldquo;for it is all stony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn't you drive it down into the bottom
of the brook, and then build your mole
up all around it?&rdquo; said Mary Anna.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dwight, &ldquo;the bottom of the
brook is stony too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks sandy,&rdquo; said Mary Anna, looking
down through the water to the bottom
of the brook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it is very hard and stony under the
sand, and we cannot drive any thing down
at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mary Anna, &ldquo;go on with
your work, and I will sit down upon the
bank and consider what you can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After some time, Mary Anna proposed
that the boys should go up to the wood-pile
and get a short log of wood, which had one
end sawed off square, and roll it down to
the mole. Then that they should dig out
a little hole in the bottom of the brook with
a hoe, so deep that when they put in the
log, the upper end would be a little above
the surface of the mole. Then she said they
might put in the log, with the sawed end
uppermost, and while one boy held it steady,
the other might throw in stones and sand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
all around it till it was secure in its place.
Then they could build the mole a little
beyond it; and thus there would be a solid
wooden block, firmly fixed in the end of the
mole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how shall we fasten our flag-staff
to it?&rdquo; said David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why you must get an augur, and bore
a hole down in the middle of it, and make
the end of your flag-staff round so that it
will just fit in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys thought this an excellent plan,
and went off after the log. While they were
gone, Mary Anna asked Caleb if he had fed
his squirrel that evening, and Caleb said he
had not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hadn't you better go now and feed him
before it is too dark?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;I don't want
to go now; besides, I am going to let Dwight
feed him to-night. I promised Dwight that
I would let him feed him sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The truth was that Caleb wanted to stay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
and see the boys fix their log. He had had
his squirrel now several days, and had lost
his interest in him, as boys generally do in
any new play-thing, after they have had it
a few days. He was really, under this show
of generosity and faithful performance of his
promise, only gratifying his own selfish desires,
but he did not see it himself. The
heart is not only selfish and sinful, but it is
deceitful; it even deceives itself.</p>

<p>So, presently, when Caleb saw David and
Dwight rolling the log down from the house,
he ran off to meet them, and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dwight you may feed my squirrel to-night,
and I will help David roll down
the log.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dwight looked up with an air of indifference,
and said he did not want to feed the
squirrel that night.</p>

<p>Caleb was quite surprised at the answer;
and he walked along by the side of Dwight
and David towards the mole, as they rolled
the log along, scarcely knowing what to do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
He did not want to leave the poor squirrel
without his supper; and, on the other hand,
he did not want to go away from the mole.
Mary Anna saw his perplexity, and she understood
the reason of it.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that Mary Anna had
been forming a very curious plan about the
squirrel, from the very day when he was
brought home; though she had not said any
thing to the boys about it. To carry her
plan into execution, it was necessary that
the squirrel should be hers; and she resolved
from the beginning, that as soon as a
convenient opportunity should offer, she
would try to buy him. She determined,
therefore, to wait quietly until she saw some
signs of Caleb's being tired of his squirrel,
and then she determined to buy him.</p>

<p>She did not suppose that Caleb would
have got tired of the care of his squirrel quite
so soon as this; but when she found that
he had, she thought that the time had arrived
for her to attempt to make the pur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>chase.
So when Caleb came back to the
mole, she said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caleb, I have a great mind to go and
feed your squirrel for you, if you want to
stay here and help the boys to make the
mole. In fact, I should like to buy him of
you, if you would like to sell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;what will you give
me for him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see&mdash;what can I make you.&rdquo;
And Mary Anna tried to think what she
could make Caleb that he would like as
well as the squirrel. She proposed first a
new picture-book, and then a flag, and next
her monthly rose; and, finally, she said she
would make him something or other, and let
him see it, and then he could tell whether
he would give his squirrel for it or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall, I know,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;for I can
see him just as well if he is yours as I can
if he is mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But perhaps I shall let him go,&rdquo; said
Mary Anna.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O no,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;you must not let
him go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I buy him of you,&rdquo; replied Mary
Anna, &ldquo;he will be mine entirely, and I must
do whatever I please with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, but I shall make you promise not to
let him go,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;or else I shall
not want to sell him to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mary Anna; &ldquo;though
you can tell better when you see what I am
going to make you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Anna then went up to the house,
and fed the squirrel, and as it began to grow
dark pretty soon after that, the boys themselves
soon came up. She asked David if
he would make her a mast, and also a small
block of wood for a step.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A step!&rdquo; said David; &ldquo;a step for
what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A step for the mast,&rdquo; said Mary
Anna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is a step for a mast?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a block, with a hole in it for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
lower end of the mast to fit into,&rdquo; said Mary
Anna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they call it a step?&rdquo; said David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mary Anna; &ldquo;I read about it
in a book where I learned about rigging.
Any little block will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>David's curiosity was very much excited,
and he begged Mary Anna to tell him what
she was going to make.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mary Anna, &ldquo;if you will
keep the secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said David, &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Chinese junk!&rdquo; said Mary Anna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Chinese junk!&rdquo; said David, with surprise
and delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, now run along to mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So David went, and Mary Anna began to
think of her work. She happened to have
recollected that there was in the garret an
old bread-tray, of japanned ware, which had
been worn out and thrown aside, and was
now good for nothing; and yet it was whole,
and Mary Anna thought it would make a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
good boat. As, however, it was not shaped
like a boat, she thought she would call it a
Chinese junk, which is a clumsy kind of
vessel, built by the Chinese. Accordingly
after the boys had gone to bed, she got all
her materials together; the old bread-tray
for the hull of the junk, some fine twine for
the rigging, David's mast and step, and a
piece of birch bark, which she thought
would represent very well the mats of which
the Chinese make their sails. She carried
all those things to her room, so as to have
them all ready for her to go to work upon
the vessel very early the next morning.</p>

<p>And early the next morning she did get
to work. On the whole, the craft, when
finished, if it was not built exactly after the
model of a real Chinese junk, would sail
about as well, and was as gay. She got it
all done before breakfast, and carried it
down, and hid it under some bushes near
the mole.</p>

<p>Then, after breakfast, she took the boys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
all down, and told Caleb that she was ready
to make him an offer for his squirrel. She
then went to the bushes, and taking out the
junk, she went to the mole, and carrying it
out to the end, she gently set it down into
the water. The boys looked on in great delight,
as the junk wheeled slowly around in
the great circles of the whirlpool.</p>

<p>Caleb hesitated a good deal before he
finally decided to give Mary Anna his squirrel,
and he tried to stipulate with her, that
is, make her agree, that she would not let
him go; but Mary Anna would not make
any such agreement. She said that if she
had the little fellow at all, she must have
him for her own, without any condition
whatever; and Caleb, at length, finding
the elegance of the Chinese junk irresistible,
decided to make the trade.</p>

<p>And now for Marianna's plan. She liked
to see the squirrel very much; she admired
his graceful movements, his beautiful grey
colour, and his bushy tail, curled over his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
back, like a plume. But then she did not
like to have him a prisoner. She knew that
he must love a life of freedom,&mdash;rambling
among the trees, climbing up to the topmost
branches, and leaping from limb to
limb; and it was painful to her to think of
his being shut up in a cage. And yet she
did not like to let him go, for then she knew
that in all probability he would run off to the
woods, and she would see him no more.</p>

<p>It happened that one limb of the great
elm before the house was hollow for a considerable
distance up from the trunk of the
tree, and there was a hole leading into this
hollow limb at the crotch, where the limb
grew out from the tree. She thought that
this would make a fine house for the squirrel,
if he could only be induced to think so
himself, and live there. It occurred to her
that she might put him in, and fasten up
the hole with wires for a time, like a cage;
and she thought that if she kept him shut
up there, and fed him there with plenty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
nuts and corn, for a week or two, he would
gradually forget his old home in the woods,
and get wonted to his new one.</p>

<p>After thinking of several ways of fastening
up the mouth of the hole, she concluded
finally on the following plan. She got
some small nails, and drove them in pretty
near together on each side of the hole, and
then she took a long piece of fine wire, and
passed it across from one to the other, in
such a manner as to cover the mouth of the
hole with a sort of net-work of wire. She
then got Raymond to put the squirrel in
through a place which she left open for that
purpose, and then she closed this place up
like the rest, with wires. The squirrel ran
up into the limb, and disappeared.</p>

<p>When the boys came and saw the ingenious
cage which Mary Anna had contrived,
they thought it was an excellent plan;
and they asked her if she was not afraid that
when she opened the cage door, he would
run off into the woods again. She said she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
was very much afraid that he would, but
that still there was a possibility that he might
stay; and if he should, she should often see
him from her window, running about the
tree, and she should take so much more
pleasure in that than in seeing him shut up
in a cage, that she thought she should prefer
to take the risk. She made the boys
promise not to go to the hole, for fear they
might frighten him, and she said she meant
to feed him herself every day, with nuts and
corn, and try to get him tame before she
took away the wires.</p>

<p>The children felt a good deal of curiosity
to see whether the squirrel would stay in the
tree or run away, when Mary Anna should
open his cage door; and after a few days,
they were eager to have her try the experiment.
But she said, no. She wished to
let him have full time to become well accustomed
to his new home.</p>

<p>Mary Anna generally went early in the
morning to feed the squirrel,&mdash;before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
boys were up. Then she fed him again after
they had gone to school, and also just
before they came home at night. She knew
that if she fed him when they were at home,
they would want to go with her; and it
would frighten the squirrel to see so many
strange faces,&mdash;even if the boys should try
to be as still as possible.</p>

<p>One morning, Mary Anna and the boys
were down near the mole, and were talking
about the squirrel. David and Dwight
were sailing their boats, and Mary Anna
was sitting with Caleb upon a bench which
David had made for his mother, close to
the shore. Caleb's junk was upon the
ground by his side. Caleb asked Mary
Anna when she was going to let her squirrel
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I don't know,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;perhaps in
a week more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A week!&rdquo; said Dwight, pushing his
boat off from the shore, &ldquo;I wouldn't wait
so long as that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, when I first had him, you wanted
to have me keep him in a cage all the
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Dwight; &ldquo;but now
I want to see whether he will run away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not try yet,&rdquo; said David&mdash;&ldquo;but
you'd better have a name for him, Marianne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have got a name for him,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Dwight, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mungo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mungo!&rdquo; repeated Dwight; &ldquo;I don't
think that is a very good name. What made
you think of that name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I heard of a traveller once, named
Mungo. The whole of his name was Mungo
Park; but I thought Mungo was enough
for my squirrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> has not been much of a traveller,&rdquo;
said Dwight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, yes,&rdquo; replied Mary Anna, &ldquo;I think
it probable he has travelled about the woods
a great deal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Mungo Park travel in the woods?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, in Africa. I think Mungo knows
his name too,&rdquo; said Mary Anna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you,&rdquo; said Dwight. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, whenever I go to feed him,&rdquo; said
Mary Anna, &ldquo;I call Mungo! Mungo! and
drop my nuts and corn down through the
wires into the hole. And now he begins to
come down when he hears my voice, and the
little rogue catches up a nut and runs off
with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he?&rdquo; said Caleb. &ldquo;O, I wish
you would let him out. I don't believe he
would run away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not just yet,&rdquo; said Mary Anna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if you don't let him out pretty soon,
I shall be gone,&rdquo; said Caleb; &ldquo;for I am
going to Boston, you know, next week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are,&rdquo; said Mary Anna; &ldquo;I
forgot that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caleb's father and mother were coming
up from Boston that week, and they had
written something about taking Caleb back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
with them, when they returned. Caleb
was much pleased with this idea. He liked
living in the country better than living in
Boston; but still, he was very much pleased
at the thought of seeing his father and
mother, and his little sister, at home. He
also liked riding, and was very glad of the
opportunity to ride several days in the
carryall, upon the front seat with his father.
He expected that his father would
let him have the whip and reins pretty often
to drive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not certain, however,&rdquo; continued
Mary Anna, &ldquo;that you will go to Boston
this summer. Mother said that perhaps
you would not go until the fall, and
then perhaps she would go with you, and
bring you back to stay here through the
winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don't want to stay here in the
<i>winter</i>,&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Mary Anna.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O, it is so cold and snowy;&mdash;and we
can't play any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's a great mistake,&rdquo; said Dwight;
&ldquo;we have fine times in the winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what can you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, a great many things; last winter we
dug out a house in a great snow-drift under
the rocks, and played in it a good deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it must be very cold in a snow-house,&rdquo;
said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, we had a fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fire?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Dwight, &ldquo;We put
some large stones for the fire-place, and let
the smoke go out at the top.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But then it would melt your house
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It did melt it a little around the sides,
and so made it grow larger: but it did not
melt it down. We had some good boards
for seats, and we could stay there in the
cold days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mary Anna, &ldquo;I remember<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
I went in one cold, windy day, and I found
you boys all snugly stowed in your snow-house,
warm and comfortable, by a good
blazing fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once we made some candy in our
snow-house,&rdquo; said David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said David; &ldquo;Mary Anna proposed
the plan, and got mother to give us
the molasses in a little kettle, and we put
it upon three stones in our snow-house, and
we boiled it all one Wednesday afternoon,
and when it was done, we poured it out upon
the snow. It was capital candy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> should like to see a snow-house,&rdquo;
said Caleb, &ldquo;very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then should not you like to stay here
next winter? And then we can make one,&rdquo;
said David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I could make one in Boston,&rdquo;
said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said Dwight, with a tone of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
contempt, &ldquo;<i>you</i> couldn't make a snow-house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there are enough other boys in
Boston to help me,&rdquo; said Caleb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is not any good place,&rdquo; said
Mary Anna, in a mild and pleasant tone.
&ldquo;There is only a very small yard, and that
is full of wood piles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can make it on the common,&rdquo; said
Caleb. &ldquo;The common is large enough I
can tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Dwight suddenly called out in a
tone of great eagerness and delight, to
look off to a little bush near them, to which
he pointed with his finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See! see! there is a squirrel!&mdash;a
large grey squirrel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;where? I don't
see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Mary Anna, in a low
tone: &ldquo;All keep perfectly still. I'll shew
him to you, Caleb. There, creeping along
the branch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see him,&rdquo; said David. &ldquo;Let us
catch him, and put him in with Mungo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm afraid it is Mungo,&rdquo; said Mary
Anna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mungo!&rdquo; said Dwight, with surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mary Anna, &ldquo;it looks like
him. I am afraid he has got out of some
hole, and is going away. Sit still, and
we will see what he will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, no,&rdquo; said Dwight, &ldquo;I will go and
catch him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, by no means,&rdquo; said Mary Anna,
holding Dwight back, &ldquo;let us see what he
will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Mungo. He had gnawed himself
a hole, and escaped from his prison.</p>

<p>He did not, however, seem disposed to go
away very fast. He came down from the
bush, and crept along upon the ground towards
the brook, and then finding that he
could not get across very well, he ran about
the grass a little while, and then went back
by degrees to the tree. He climbed up to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the great branch, playing a minute or two
about the grating over the hole, and then
ran along out to the end of the branch, the
children watching him all the time, and
walking slowly along up towards the tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll go and get him some corn,&rdquo; said
Mary Anna, &ldquo;and see if he will not come
down for it to his hole, when I call him.
You stand here perfectly still, till I come
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she went in and got a nut instead of
corn, and put it down by the hole, calling
&ldquo;Mungo!&rdquo; &ldquo;Mungo!&rdquo; as usual. The
squirrel came creeping down the branch,
and Mary Anna left the nut upon the grating,
and went away. He crept down cautiously,
seized the nut, stuffed it into his
cheek, and ran off to one of the topmost
branches; and there standing upon his
hind legs, and holding his nut in his forepaws,
he began gnawing the shell, watching
the children all the time.</p>

<p>The next morning, Mary Anna tore off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
the netting, and the squirrel lived in the
tree a long while. Caleb, however, saw
but little more of him at this time, for he
went to Boston the next week with his father.
What befell him there may perhaps
be described in another book, to be called
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Caleb in Town</span>.&rdquo;</p>
